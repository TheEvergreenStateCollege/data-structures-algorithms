Sun Tzu divided them into two com-\\npanies, and placed one of the King\u2019s favorite concubines at the head of\\neach. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed\\nthem thus: \"I presume you know the difference between front and back,\\nrighthandandlefthand?\"\\nThegirlsreplied: Yes.\\nSunTzuwenton:\"WhenIsay\"Eyesfront,\"youmustlookstraightahead.\\nWhenIsay\"Leftturn,\"youmustfacetowardsyourlefthand.

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) card 308\\n10TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nIntroduction\\nThe \u201cBlue Book\u201d\\nSince 1775, U.S. Army\\nSoldiers exhibited\\nunwavering courage, self- discipline, military expertise, and\\nesprit de corps, through tough, challenging military training\\nand combat operations. Soldiers, like you, volunteered to\\nserve and fight to protect their families and friends from\\nenemies that sought to do us harm, and to defend the ideals\\nof our nation.\\nWe gain strength from training, and the basis for our training\\nstems from a past deeply rooted in determination and\\nadaptability.\\nFrom the beginning,\\nAmerican Soldiers were\\nbrave and fought with\\ndetermination but were at a\\nmilitary disadvantage when\\nfighting against highly\\ntrained and better organized British and Hessian Soldiers.\\nTo win the Revolutionary War, General George\\nWashington\u2019s Army needed training, discipline, and esprit\\nde corps.\\nSeeking a solution, General Washington tasked Baron von\\nSteuben with transforming the large group of hungry and\\nexhausted men at Valley Forge into a disciplined fighting\\nforce. In the harsh Pennsylvania winter, Baron von Steuben\\ninstructed a company of future leaders in basic military\\n11TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nmovements and tactical skills; those individuals were the\\npredecessors of our Drill Sergeants!\\nHe developed those cadre members until they could, in turn,\\ntrain the entire Revolutionary Army in the art of basic military\\nmaneuvers. Through their perseverance and sense of duty,\\nthese dedicated troops achieved the highest standards. As\\na result, Washington\u2019s men fought skillfully and\\ndemonstrated the discipline of a professional Army.\\nUltimately, the Army won the Revolutionary war and\\nindependence after 8 years of fighting.\\nTraining to standard and developing the commitment to\\nadapt and overcome adversity became the hallmarks of the\\nAmerican Soldier. Baron von Steuben, by then the Army\\nInspector General, wrote the Regulations for the Order and\\nDiscipline of the Troops of the United States\u2014now\\ncommonly referred to as the Soldier\u2019s Blue Book\u2014an\\ninstructional guide for future generations. This book consists\\nof detailed training procedures, the standards of military\\nconduct, and the fundamentals every Soldier needs to\\nknow.\\nUse this Soldier\u2019s Blue Book on the journey you are about to\\nundertake. Just as the Soldiers before you trained to serve\\nand protect our Nation, this book will help you to learn, train\\nand perform the tasks required of you to become Soldiers in\\nthe U.S. Army.\\n12TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nChapter 1 \u2013 The Army\\nOn 14 June 1775, the Second Continental Congress\\nestablished \u201cthe American Continental Army.\u201d The U.S.\\nArmy is the senior Service of the Armed Forces. As one of\\nthe oldest American institutions, it predates the Declaration\\nof Independence and the Constitution. For almost two and a\\nhalf centuries, Army forces have protected this Nation. Our\\nArmy flag is adorned with over 190 campaign and battle\\nstreamers to date, each one signifying great sacrifice on\\nbehalf of the Nation.\\nThe Army\u2019s mission is to fight and win the Nation\u2019s wars\\nthrough prompt and sustained land combat, as part of the\\njoint force.\\n13TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n1-1. Why we have an Army\\nIt is the intent of Congress to provide an Army that is\\ncapable, in conjunction with the other armed forces,\\nof-\\nPreserving the peace and security, and\\nproviding for the defense of the United States,\\nthe Commonwealths and possessions, and any\\nareas occupied by the United States;\\nSupporting the national policies; Implementing\\nthe national objectives; and\\nOvercoming any nations responsible for\\naggressive acts that imperil the peace and\\nsecurity of the United States.\\nTitle 10, U.S. Code, Section 7062(a)\\n14TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 1-1. Army timeline\\n15TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 1-2. Army timeline - 1775 to present\\n16TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n1-2. What the Army uniform represents\\nArmy uniforms include those designed for formal occasions,\\nduty within an office or in garrison, and for tactical training\\nand operations. Wearing the uniform of a U.S. Army Soldier\\nis an honor and a privilege which must be earned. When we\\ntake our Oath of Service and are authorized to wear the\\nuniform, we incur a sacred obligation to live by and uphold\\nthe moral principles of the Army Ethic and perform our duty\\nprofessionally.\\nFor Army Families, the uniform is a source of both pride and\\nsacrifice.\\nLiving by and upholding the Army Ethic is our life-long\\ncommitment. For our veterans, it represents one of the most\\nimportant periods of their lives: pride in honorable service,\\naccomplishments as part of a team, and a life-long\\nconnection to the comrades with whom they served, and in\\nsome cases, lost during their time in uniform.\\nWhen Soldiers return to society as private citizens, they are\\nexpected to continue to be moral-ethical role models for\\ntheir Families and communities, contributing to the well-\\nbeing of the United States of America, as Soldiers for Life.\\nFor the American people, Soldiers are their sons, daughters,\\nrelatives, and neighbors. In us they see patriotism,\\nhonorable service, and courage.\\nBeing seen as defenders of our freedoms you are expected\\nto earn and sustain the trust of our society.\\nPeople around the world recognize the American Soldier as\\na symbol of the United States and its values, democracy,\\n17TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nand a commitment to defend the right of all people to life,\\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\nTo our enemies, the Soldier represents American strength,\\nresolve, and a commitment to defend the values that we\\nhold dear as a Nation.\\n1-3. Why we serve\\nAs Soldiers, we are committed to do our duty to contribute\\nto the \u201ccommon defense;\u201d we share a love of our country\\nand of our Army Family; we defend American values that\\nframe the nation as expressed in the Declaration of\\nIndependence and the Constitution of the United States;\\nand we serve \u201cnot to promote war, but to preserve peace.\u201d\\n1-4. The Army\u2019s Motto \u2013 \u201cThis We\u2019ll Defend\u201d\\nThe Army\u2019s motto remains as relevant today as it did at our\\nNation\u2019s founding. The pronoun \u201cWe\u201d reinforces our\\ncollective team effort and \u201cDefend\u201d remains our Army\u2019s main\\nmission. The Army continues this pledge into the future, as\\nwe have done since 1775.\\nDepartment of the Army Emblem\\n18TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n1-5. Oath of Enlistment\\nMembers of the American Armed Services swear or affirm\\nto support and defend the Constitution of the United\\nStates\u2014not a leader, people, government, or territory.\\nThat solemn oath ties service in the Army directly to the\\nfounding document of the United States. The oath\\nexpresses a noble calling to honorable service on behalf of\\nthe American people.\\nWe serve because we believe America must be defended\\nby a Professional Army of Soldiers and Army Civilians who\\nare inspired to honorably fulfill their Oaths of Service. We\\naccomplish our missions as a team, partnering with the\\nother armed forces in the joint community and with\\ngovernment services that dedicate themselves to defending\\nthe U.S. Constitution and protect the Nation\u2019s interests, at\\nhome and abroad, against all threats.\u201d\\nFigure 1-3. Army Oath of Enlistment\\n19TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nChapter 2 \u2013 The Army as a Profession\\n2-1. The Army Profession\\nOur shared identity, as trusted Army professionals, derives\\nfrom our shared understanding of and respect for those\\nwhose legacy we celebrate. We honor this cherished\\ninheritance in our customs, courtesies, and traditions. Units\\nand organizations preserve their storied histories and\\nproudly display distinctive emblems (regimental colors,\\ncrests, insignia, patches, and mottos). The campaign\\nstreamers on the Army flag remind us of our history of\\nhonorable service to the Nation. These symbols recall the\\nsacrifices and preserve the ties with those who preceded us.\\nFigure 2-1. Army Profession\\nThe essential Characteristics of the Army profession are:\\nTrust, Military Expertise, Honorable Service, Stewardship\\n20TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nand Esprit de Corps.\\nOur Army Profession includes two mutually supporting\\ncommunities of practice\u2014\\n\u2022 The Profession of Arms: Soldiers of the Regular\\nArmy, Army National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve.\\n\u2022 The Army Civilian Corps composed of civilian\\nprofessionals serving in the Department of the Army.\\nThe Army Ethic: The heart of the Army and the inspiration\\nfor our shared professional identity \u2013 Who we are and why\\nand how we serve. It motivates and guides our conduct as\\nSoldiers and Army Civilians who are bound together with the\\nArmy Culture of trust in common moral purpose.\\n2-2. What it means to be a Soldier\\nSoldiers are trusted professionals of character, competence,\\nand commitment. The Army is an honored profession,\\nfounded on the bedrock of trust \u2013 trust among leaders,\\npeers, and subordinates; between Soldiers and Army\\nCivilians; trust in the Army professionals, and their families;\\nand trust between the Army and the American people. By\\nour solemn oath, we are morally committed to support and\\ndefend the Constitution. This duty requires a foundation of\\ntrust with the American people who grant us autonomy to\\nuse lethal force on their behalf, only because we have\\nearned their trust. Army professionals understand and\\naccept that they may give their lives and justly take the lives\\nof others to accomplish the mission. The moral implications\\nof this realization compel essential bonds of mutual trust\\nwithin cohesive teams. The Nation tasks the Army to do\\nmany things besides combat operations, but ultimately, the\\n21TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nmission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation\u2019s\\nwars through prompt and sustained land combat as part of\\nthe joint force. The Army and each of its members must\\nmaintain the readiness to accomplish this mission, now and\\nin the future. Once a Soldier, always a Soldier\u2026A Soldier\\nfor Life.\\n2-3. Who we are not\\nArmy Professionals do not engage in or tolerate acts of\\nmisconduct or unethical decisions. Soldiers do not lie,\\ncheat, steal, or treat others and their property with\\ndisrespect. Actions such as sexual harassment, sexual\\nassault, and hazing are dishonorable and violate the Army\\nValues and the Army Ethic while destroying trust, unit\\ncohesion, and esprit de corps. One incident is one too\\nmany.\\nSexual harassment is a form of discrimination that involves\\nunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,\\nand deliberate or repeated offensive comments or gestures\\nof a sexual nature.\\nSexual assault is intentional sexual contact, characterized\\nby use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or\\nwhen the victim does not or cannot consent. The term\\nincludes a broad range of sexual offenses including the\\nfollowing specific Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)\\noffenses: rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact,\\nabusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy (forced oral or anal\\nsex), and attempts to commit these acts.\\nHazing is defined as any conduct whereby one military\\nmember or employee, regardless of Service or rank,\\n22TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nunnecessarily causes another military member or employee,\\nregardless of Service or rank, to suffer or be exposed to an\\nactivity that is cruel, abusive, or harmful.\\nBullying is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse\\nintimidate, or aggressively dominate others. The behavior is\\noften repeated and habitual.\\n2-4. The Army\u2019s commitment to you\\nOur commitment to you is to help guide you on this journey\\nfrom an aspiring member of the Army Profession to a\\nSoldier who is certified in character, competence, and\\ncommitment.\\nWe are committed to providing you with a safe and secure\\nenvironment where everyone can live, train, and learn, while\\ndeveloping into Soldiers of\u2026\\n\u2022 Character: Soldiers who understand, adhere to, and\\nuphold the Army Ethic, as demonstrated by their\\ndecisions and actions.\\n\u2022 Competence: Soldiers who demonstrate the ability\\nto perform their duty with discipline and to standard.\\n\u2022 Commitment: Soldiers who demonstrate the resolve\\nto contribute honorable service to the Nation and\\naccomplish the mission despite adversity, obstacles,\\nand challenges.\\nIn turn, you join the ranks of generations of Soldiers who\\npreviously answered the call to defend America\u2019s freedoms;\\nyou join a band of brothers and sisters who are prepared to\\nserve this Nation in peace and in war; and you join the Army\\nProfession, a profession dedicated to upholding the values\\n23TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nand ideals of our Country and its people that we serve and\\nrepresent.\\nOur desired outcome as you complete your initial\\ncertification process is to provide the Army with a Soldier:\\n\u2022 Competent in basic combat skills and unique\\nspecialties.\\n\u2022 Who is a disciplined individual of character.\\n\u2022 Who is physically fit and ready to execute required\\nSoldier and occupational specialty skills.\\n\u2022 Acculturated with Army Values, the Soldier\u2019s Creed,\\nand Army history.\\n\u2022 Who is a trusted member of the Army team.\\n\u2022 Committed to serving the Army and Nation.\\n\u2022 Who is mentally capable and committed to serve as\\na trusted member of a team in their first unit of\\nassignment.\\n2-5. The journey begins\\nWhen you took the Oath of Enlistment, you became a\\nmember of the Army Profession, albeit an aspiring\\nprofessional.\\nThe task at hand is to develop and certify you in Character,\\nCompetence, and Commitment. The responsibility for\\neveryone\u2019s development and certification is a mutual one, a\\ntrusted bond, shared between you, your leaders, and the\\nArmy.\\n24TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe first certification in becoming an Army Professional\\nincludes demonstrating the knowledge and skills to serve as\\na trusted Soldier in your first unit of assignment.\\n2-6. Army Values\\nOur ethical and moral foundation as Soldiers is solidified in\\nthe seven Army Values: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless\\nService, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.\\nThey are at the core of who we are as individuals, as\\nSoldiers, as Professionals and as Americans. Whether on or\\noff-duty, Soldiers live these values every day.\\nThe easiest way to remember the Army Values is through\\nthe acronym \u201cLDRSHIP\u201d.\\nFigure 2-2. Army Values\\n25TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nLOYALTY: Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S.\\nConstitution, the Army, your unit, and other Soldiers.\\nBearing true faith and allegiance is a matter of believing in\\nand devoting yourself to something or someone. A loyal\\nSoldier is one who supports the leadership and stands up\\nfor fellow Soldiers. By wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army,\\nyou express your loyalty. Doing your share displays loyalty\\nto your unit.\\nDUTY: Fulfill your obligations.\\nPerforming your duty means more than carrying out your\\nassigned tasks. Duty means the ability to accomplish tasks\\nas part of a team. The work of the U.S. Army is a complex\\ncombination of missions, tasks, and responsibilities \u2014 all in\\nconstant motion. Our work entails building one assignment\\nonto another. You fulfill your obligations as a part of your\\nunit every time you resist the temptation to take \u201cshortcuts\u201d\\nthat might undermine the integrity of the final product.\\nRESPECT: Treat people as they should be treated.\\nIn the Soldier\u2019s Code, we pledge to \u201ctreat others with dignity\\nand respect while expecting others to do the same.\u201d\\nRespect is what allows us to appreciate the best in other\\npeople. Respect is trusting that all people performed their\\njobs and fulfilled their duty. Self-respect is a vital ingredient\\nwith the Army value of respect, which results from knowing\\nyou put your best effort forward. The Army is one team and\\neach of us contributes something.\\nSELFLESS SERVICE: Put the welfare of the Nation, the\\nArmy, and your subordinates before your own.\\n26TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSelfless service is larger than just one person. In serving\\nyour country, you are doing your duty loyally without thought\\nof recognition or gain. The basic building block of selfless\\nservice is the commitment of each team member to go a\\nlittle further, endure a little longer, and look a little closer to\\nsee how he or she can add to the effort.\\nHONOR: Live up to all the Army Values.\\nThe nation\u2019s highest military award is The Medal of Honor.\\nThis award goes to Soldiers who make honor a matter of\\ndaily living \u2014 Soldiers who develop the habit of being\\nhonorable and solidify that habit with every value choice\\nthey make. Honor is a matter of carrying out, acting, and\\nliving the values of respect, duty, loyalty, selfless service,\\nintegrity, and personal courage in everything you do.\\nINTEGRITY: Do what\u2019s right, legally and morally.\\nIntegrity is a quality you develop by adhering to moral\\nprinciples. It requires that you do and say nothing that\\ndeceives others. As your integrity grows, so does the trust\\nothers place in you. The more choices you make based on\\nintegrity, the more this highly prized value will affect your\\nrelationships with family and friends, and, finally, the\\nfundamental acceptance of yourself.\\nPERSONAL COURAGE: Face fear, danger, or adversity\\n(physical or moral).\\nPersonal courage has long been associated with our Army.\\nWith physical courage, it is a matter of enduring physical\\nduress and at times risking personal safety. Facing moral\\nfear or adversity may be a long, slow process of continuing\\nforward on the right path, especially if taking those actions is\\n27TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nnot popular with others. You can build your personal\\ncourage daily by standing up for and acting upon the things\\nthat you know are honorable.\\nNote: Information identified by a \u201cstar\u201d requires\\nmemorization.\\n2-7.

Soldier\u2019s Creed\\n28TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n2-8. Expectations for Army Soldiers and Leaders\\na. American Soldiers live the Golden Rule, Army\\nValues, the Soldier\u2019s Creed, and the Warrior Ethos. Soldiers\\ndo their best, enforce standards, and get the job done.\\nSoldiers persevere despite privation, chaos, and\\nuncertainty; refusing to quit or lose.\\nb. American Soldiers are Skilled. Able to perform their\\ntasks in the dark, in the rain, under fire, and without thinking\\nabout it. The rest of the Army can count on them to do their\\njob.\\nc. American Soldiers are Tough. Army Tough\u2026\\nResilient\u2026mentally and physically. Tough and resilient\\nenough to be comfortable being uncomfortable, to take a\\nsurprise or shock and bounce right back into the fight, to\\nmove as far and fast as necessary, and to fight as long and\\nas hard as necessary to win.\\nd. American Soldiers are Ready to deploy, move, or\\nfight. They are mentally prepared for anything.\\ne. American Soldiers are Alert. They \u201clive on Amber.\u201d\\nThey pay attention to what is going on around them, see\\nwhat is coming towards them, and notice when something is\\nout of place. A curious scout is looking behind doors and\\nunderneath tarps on patrol. They have an edge in combat\\nbecause they see bad things before they happen.\\nf. American Soldiers are confident. Confident in\\nthemselves, at their job, with their weapon, in their\\nteammates and their unit.\\n29TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ng. American Soldiers act with disciplined initiative.\\nSoldiers do the right thing even when no one is looking.\\nSoldiers do not sit and wait for orders. They determine what\\nneeds to be done and do it without being told. Soldiers\\nfollow SOPs and orders but are smart enough to see when\\nthe plan is failing; no longer fits the situation or the enemy is\\npresenting an opportunity; smart enough to come up with a\\nnew plan that will work and have the guts enough to do it.\\nh. Army Leaders lead by personal example. They share\\nrisks and hardships with their Soldiers. They lead by the\\nconcepts of mission command, mission orders and\\ncommander\u2019s intent to empower the disciplined initiative of\\ntheir troops. They carefully plan, in advance, but stay\\nflexible in execution. They are not afraid to take measured\\nrisks or to act decisively when the situation is uncertain.\\ni. Army Leaders are responsible and accountable for\\ntheir decisions, their troops, and their equipment.\\nj. Army Leaders know that, foremost, they must train\\ntheir Soldiers to fight, win, and come home alive. They\\nknow, \u201cthe more we sweat in peace, the less we bleed in\\nwar.\u201d They know we must practice being operationally\\neffective in miserable conditions and we will fight like we\\ntrain.\\nk. Army Leaders ensure their unit is secure, postured,\\nand ready to move or fight on short notice. They check\\nsecurity before bedding down. They are never surprised by\\nthe enemy because they take precautions to prevent\\nsurprise.\\n30TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nChapter 3 \u2013 The Reception Battalion\\n3-1. The Path\\nWelcome to the reception battalion. Being here means that\\nyou met your initial entry qualification requirements. While at\\nthe military entrance processing station (MEPS) you\\nunderwent a battery of aptitude tests and medical\\nexaminations to determine if you were qualified for military\\nservice. Congratulations, you passed!\\nYou were vetted mentally, physically, and intellectually, by\\npassing the Occupational Physical Assessment Test\\n(OPAT), and the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude\\nBattery (ASVAB). You know your future military\\noccupational specialty (MOS) \u2013 what your job entails, and\\nqualified for that job by taking and passing the OPAT and\\nwere sworn into the U.S. Army. Now it\u2019s time for you to\\nbegin the transformation to becoming a Soldier.\\nYou are at one of the following BCT/OSUT locations:\\n\u2022 Fort Moore, Georgia\\n\u2022 Fort Jackson, South Carolina\\n\u2022 Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri\\n\u2022 Fort Sill, Oklahoma\\nIf your MOS is 11B/11C (Infantryman), 19D (Cavalry Scout),\\n19K (Armor Crewman), 12B (Combat Engineer) or 31B\\n(Military Police Officer), you will conduct your BCT and\\noccupational skills training in one course. This is called \u201cOne\\nStation Unit Training\u201d or \u201cOSUT\u201d. OSUT is conducted at Fort\\n31TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMoore for 11B and 19K Soldiers, and at Fort Leonard Wood\\nfor 12B and 31B Soldiers.\\nAll other Soldiers will go through BCT at one of the four\\nlocations listed above, and upon completion, will attend a\\nfollow-on course called \u201cAdvanced Individual Training\u201d or\\n\u201cAIT.\u201d This course may be at the same installation as your\\nBCT training or may be at another location.\\nAt the successful completion of OSUT or AIT, you will be\\nawarded your MOS and receive a basic understanding of\\ncharacter, competence, and commitment as a trusted Army\\nprofessional and Soldier for Life.\\nWhile at the reception battalion, you will undergo further\\nmedical and dental processing. Medical and dental\\nprocessing includes collection of blood for certain\\nimmunities, type, and deoxyribonucleic acid (known as\\nDNA); hearing and vision exams (in addition to the MEPS\\nexams); pregnancy screening; tuberculosis screening;\\nimmunizations; and a brief dental exam and x-rays. You will\\nreceive ear plugs, mouth guard, eyewear, eye protection,\\nand personal protective items such as sunscreen. These are\\nall items of \u201cindividual medical readiness\u201d that you will\\nmaintain throughout your career.\\nYou will also undergo further administrative processing\\n(personnel and finance records, and security clearance if\\napplicable).\\nYou will receive a standard military haircut, be issued your\\ninitial clothing requirement, to include physical fitness and\\nArmy combat uniforms (ACUs), footwear and miscellaneous\\nclothing items. You will be taught how to properly wear the\\n32TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nclothing issued and begin to learn the basics of military\\nculture.\\nYour actions and ability to follow instructions will be\\nmonitored carefully. A drill sergeant or cadre member will\\ntake you through the stations required for you to enter the\\nArmy.\\nFollow all instructions and pay attention to detail. One of the\\nkey elements to being successful in the Army is to\\nunderstand what is required of you and to ask questions if\\nyou are unsure.\\nA typical stay in the reception battalion lasts 3-5 days for\\nBCT Soldiers and 5-7 days for OSUT Soldiers.\\nAfter completing reception in-processing, you will be\\nassigned to a training company. Drill sergeants will pick you\\nup at the reception battalion and travel with you to your BCT\\nor OSUT company location.\\nEagleCash Value Card: While at the reception battalion,\\nyou will be issued an EagleCash Value Card, which has a\\nvalue of $350.00 for males and $756.60 for females, as your\\ninitial advance of pay. This includes the $406.60 cash\\nallowance for females as part of their initial clothing\\nallowance. The stored value card reduces cash/check\\noperations. The card can be used at the Army and Air Force\\nExchange Service (AAFES) sites\\n(barber shops, clothing sales, and\\nPost Exchange facilities).\\nAny remaining value at expiration is\\nreturned to the Soldier; however, you\\nwill likely spend the full amount prior to completion of your\\n33TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ntraining. If you deploy immediately with your first unit of\\nassignment, you may retain the card for up to 5 years.\\n3-2. Critical information needed upfront\\nDuring your stay at the reception battalion, BCT or OSUT,\\nyou are expected to read, study, and memorize necessary\\ninformation. The purpose of the information is to introduce\\nand reinforce who we are as Army Professionals and what\\nwe represent as Soldiers. Your job is to fully understand,\\ncomprehend and demonstrate your proficiency by reciting it\\nto the drill sergeant and leaders either individually or as a\\ngroup.\\n3-3. The Battle Buddy System\\nSoldiers rely on one another to stay motivated and reach\\npeak performance. Although required in Initial Military\\nTraining, Soldiers will form natural bonds with their fellow\\nSoldiers as part of Army culture. To contribute to this team\\nspirit, we live by the buddy system. A buddy team is usually\\ndefined as two Soldiers (same gender) in the same unit who\\nalways look after each other.\\nBy getting to know other Soldiers on a professional and\\npersonal level, you learn how to improve yourself and\\nencourage others. Working together, you and your battle\\nbuddy learn initiative, responsibility, trust, and dependability.\\nWhile at the reception battalion, BCT or OSUT, same-\\ngender Soldiers (male-male and female-female) are placed\\nin buddy teams.

To avoid confusion due to time differences, the\\nmilitary uses the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) zones,\\nwhere a phonetic alphabet is assigned to different regions\\nacross the world according to the number of hours they are\\nEast or West of the Prime Meridian. The military often refers\\nto ZULU (Z) time zone, or UTC+00:00, which is also the\\n52TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ntime zone name for Greenwich, England. For example, 7:00\\na.m. in UTC is written as 0700Z and spoken as \u201czero seven\\nhundred Zulu\u201d.\\n4-11.

If your body fat exceeds the\\nstandards, you have six months (180 days) to meet\\nweight/body fat compliance in Army Regulation 600-9.\\n4-12. What is the difference between drill sergeants\\nand platoon sergeants (PSG)?\\nThe difference between drill sergeants and platoon\\nsergeants is the environment in which they train you. Your\\nBCT experience will be highly supervised by drill sergeants\\nas you are encouraged and evaluated on your ability to\\nreach the highest Army standards. The drill sergeant\\nenforces standards, and their focus is on \u201cattention to\\ndetail.\u201d Their job is to ensure you are mentally and\\nphysically fit to earn your place as a member of a team and\\nbe able to contribute as a soldier in AIT and first unit.\\nDuring AIT and the latter portion of OSUT, the drill sergeant\\nworks with instructors and cadre members on a training\\nenvironment that best prepares you for your first unit of\\nassignment (FUA). You will learn your job skills and\\nadditional Soldier skills in an atmosphere geared to prepare\\nyou to perform your occupational specialty in a unit.\\nIn your first unit of assignment, you will report to your\\nplatoon leader (PL) and/or platoon sergeant (PSG) and\\nsquad leaders (SQD LDR) that are assigned to your\\ncompany. The roles of the PL/PSG and SQD LDRs are\\n55TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ncomparable even though they train Soldiers in different\\nenvironments. Drill sergeants transform new recruits into\\nSoldiers. PL/PSG and SQD LDRs reinforce the training you\\nlearned in BCT/AIT/OSUT and prepare you for your\\nassignment in the company where standard operating\\nprocedures (SOP) are followed.\\nPLs, PSGs, SQD LDRs and MOS Instructors train Soldiers\\nto become proficient at their MOS/Army job.\\nYour SQD LDR and PSG will counsel and mentor you to\\nhelp further develop your skills as a soldier and a member of\\nthe team. The PSG is normally a sergeant first class (E-7)\\nbut can be a staff sergeant (E-6) and has 3-4 squad leaders\\nthat assist him/her in your development. The PSG helps\\nwith assignment instructions, any training or family issues,\\nand provides guidance throughout your assignment.\\nAIT drill sergeants\u2019 help Soldiers transition from a\\ncompletely supervised environment to one that involves\\n56TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nmore individual responsibility. This gives you a better\\nunderstanding of the duties, discipline, and responsibilities\\nyou must maintain as a Soldier. Your adventure has just\\nstarted. Challenges await you and demand your complete\\nattention to detail. Be proud of the accomplishments you\\ncomplete and look forward to the journey ahead of you.\\nOnce a Soldier, always a Soldier.\\n4-13. General orders and special orders\\nGeneral orders:\\n1. I will guard everything within the limits of my post\\nand quit my post only when properly relieved.\\n2. I will obey my special orders and perform all my\\nduties in a military manner.\\n3. I will report violations of my special orders,\\nemergencies, and anything not covered in my\\ninstructions to the commander of relief.\\n57TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSpecial orders: Additional requirements or instructions that\\naugment the general orders.\\n4-14.

It is\\nindicative of esprit de corps and morale within a unit.\\nSoldiers have an individual responsibility to ensure their\\nappearance reflects the highest level of professionalism.\\nYour uniform is only part of your appearance. To look like a\\nSoldier, you need to be physically fit, meet acceptable\\nweight standards, have a neat hairstyle in accordance with\\nArmy regulations, and always conduct yourself in a manner\\nreflecting your professional status treating others with\\ndignity and respect.\\nNote: While attending BCT/OSUT/AIT some of the personal\\nappearance allowances may be restricted while undergoing\\ntraining. Your drill sergeants, cadre, and instructors will\\ninform you of these restrictions.\\nSee Army Regulation (AR) 670-1 and/or DA Pamphlet 670-1\\nfor additional inquiries concerning Army uniforms and\\nawards.\\nNote: When traveling from BCT to AIT you will wear ACUs,\\nor appropriate civilian attire, directed by the commander.\\nThe Army Green Service Uniform (AGSU) may be directed\\nby the Commander when traveling to AIT, Holiday Block\\nLeave, or other authorized leave locations.\\n61TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nGrooming standards for male personnel.

While at BCT,\\nfemales are not required to receive a standard haircut.\\nThe requirements for hair regulations are to maintain\\nuniformity within a military population for female Soldiers\\nwhile in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty, unless\\notherwise specified. Hairstyles may not be eccentric or\\nfaddish and will present a conservative, professional\\nappearance. For the purpose of these regulations, female\\nhairstyles are organized into three basic categories: short\\nlength, medium length, and long length hair. See AR 670-1\\nfor more information.\\nShort length. Short hair is defined as hair length that\\nextends no more than 1 inch (25.4 millimeter) from the scalp\\n(excluding bangs). Hair may be no shorter than 1/4 inch (.25\\nmillimeter) from the scalp (unless due to medical condition\\nor injury) but may be evenly tapered to the scalp within 2\\ninches (50.8 mm) of the hair line edges. Bangs, if worn, may\\nnot fall below the eyebrows, may not interfere with the wear\\nof all headgear, must lie neatly against the head, and not be\\nvisible underneath the front of the headgear. The width of\\nthe bangs may extend to the hairline at the temple.\\nMedium length. Medium hair is defined as hair length that\\ndoes not extend beyond the lower edge of the collar (in all\\nuniforms) and extends more than 1 inch (25.4 mm) from the\\nscalp.\\n63TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMedium hair may fall naturally in uniform and is not required\\nto be secured. When worn loose, graduated hair styles are\\nacceptable, but the length, as measured from the end of the\\ntotal hair length to the base of the collar, may not exceed 1\\ninch (25.4 mm) difference in length, from the front to the\\nback. Layered hairstyles are also authorized, so long as\\neach hair\u2019s length, as measured from the scalp to the hair\u2019s\\nend, is generally the same length giving a tapered\\nappearance. The regulations for the wear of bangs detailed\\nabove, apply. No portion of the bulk of the hair, as\\nmeasured from the scalp, will exceed 2 inches (50.8 mm).\\nLong length. Long hair is defined as hair length that\\nextends beyond the lower edge of the collar. Long hair will\\nbe neatly and inconspicuously fastened or pinned, except\\nthat bangs may be worn. The regulations for the wear of\\nbangs detailed above, apply. No portion of the bulk of the\\nhair, as measured from the scalp, will exceed 2 inches (50.8\\nmm) (except a bun, which may extend a maximum of 3\\ninches (76.2 mm) from the scalp) and be no wider than the\\nwidth of the head. Long length hair may be worn in a\\nponytail during physical training. A single ponytail centered\\non the back of the head is authorized only when within the\\nscope of physical training, except when considered a safety\\nhazard. The ponytail is not required to be worn above the\\ncollar.\\nWhen hair securing devices are worn, they will comply with\\nthe guidelines. Hairstyles otherwise authorized in this\\nchapter (such as braids and twists) may also be worn in a\\nponytail during physical training.\\n64TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nBraids, cornrows, and twists. Medium and long hair may\\nbe styled with braids, cornrows, or twists (see glossary for\\ndefinitions). Each braid, cornrow, or twist will be of uniform\\ndimension, have a diameter no greater than 1/2 inch, (6.35\\nmm) and present a neat, professional, and well-groomed\\nappearance. Each must have the same approximate size of\\nspacing between the braids, cornrows, or twists. Each\\nhairstyle may be worn against the scalp or loose (free\\nhanging). When worn loose, such hairstyles must be worn\\nper medium hair length guidelines or secured to the head in\\nthe same manner as described for medium or long length\\nhair styles. Ends must be secured inconspicuously. When\\nmultiple loose braids or twists are worn, they must\\nencompass the whole head. When braids, twists, or\\ncornrows are not worn loosely and instead worn close to the\\nscalp, they may stop at one consistent location of the head\\nand must follow the natural direction of the hair when worn\\nback, which is either in general straight lines following the\\nshape of the head or flowing with the natural direction of the\\nhair when worn back with one primary part in the hair.\\nHairstyles may not be styled with designs, sharply curved\\nlines, or zigzag lines. Only one distinctive style (braided,\\nrolled, or twisted) may be worn at one time. Braids,\\ncornrows, or twists that distinctly protrude (up or out) from\\nthe head are not authorized.\\nDreadlocks or locks. Female Soldiers may wear\\ndreadlocks or locks in accordance with the guidance for\\nbraids, cornrows, and twists.\\n65TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nJewelry\\nA wristwatch, identification bracelet, and up to two rings (a\\nwedding set is one other ring) may be worn with your\\nuniform if they are conservative and tasteful. Soldiers may\\nalso wear one activity tracker, pedometer, or heart rate\\nmonitor. You may wear a religious medal on a chain around\\nyour neck provided neither medal nor chain can be seen.\\nEarrings may be screw-on, clip-on, or post-type earrings, in\\ngold, silver, white pearl, or diamond. The earrings will not\\nexceed 6 mm or 1\u20444 inch (6.35 mm) in diameter, and they\\nmust be unadorned and spherical. When worn, the earrings\\nwill fit snugly against the ear. Females may wear earrings\\nonly as a matched pair, with only one earring per ear lobe.\\nNote: Soldiers are not authorized to wear earrings with any\\nclass C (utility) uniform (ACU, hospital duty, food service,\\nphysical fitness, field, or organizational).\\nBody piercing\\nNo displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation\\nattached or affixed to or through the skin may be worn while\\nin uniform. Such adornments are not allowed while wearing\\ncivilian clothes (on or off duty) when on any military\\ninstallation, or other places under military control. When not\\nin uniform and off duty, earring wear is not restricted if the\\nearrings do not create or support ear gauging (enlarged\\nholes in the lobe of the ear, greater than 1.6mm). Follow\\nArmy Regulation 670-1 guidance.\\n66TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nCosmetics\\nStandards regarding cosmetics are necessary to maintain\\nuniformity and to avoid an extreme or unprofessional\\nappearance. Males are prohibited from wearing cosmetics,\\nexcept when medically prescribed. Females are authorized\\nto wear cosmetics with all uniforms, provided they are\\napplied modestly and conservatively, and that they\\ncomplement both the Soldier\u2019s complexion and the uniform.\\nLeaders at all levels must exercise professional judgment\\nwhen interpreting and enforcing this policy. Eccentric,\\nexaggerated, or faddish cosmetic styles and colors, to\\ninclude makeup designed to cover tattoos, are inappropriate\\nwith the uniform and are prohibited.\\nPermanent makeup, such as eyebrow or eyeliner, is\\nauthorized if the makeup conforms to the standards outlined\\nabove. Eyelash extensions are not authorized unless\\nmedically prescribed.\\nFemales will not wear shades of lipstick that distinctly\\ncontrast with the natural color of their lips, that detract from\\nthe uniform, or that are faddish, eccentric, or exaggerated.\\nFemales will comply with the cosmetics policy while in any\\nmilitary uniform or while in civilian clothes on duty.\\nFingernails\\nAll personnel will keep fingernails clean and neatly trimmed.\\nMales will keep nails trimmed so as not to extend beyond\\nthe fingertip.\\nFemales will not exceed a nail length of 1\u20444 inch (6.35 mm)\\nas measured from the tip of the finger.

Customs and Courtesies\\nSaluting\\nThe origin of the hand salute is uncertain. Some historians\\nbelieve it began in late Roman times when assassinations\\nwere common. A citizen who wanted to see a public official\\nhad to approach with his right hand raised to show that he\\ndid not hold a weapon. Knights in armor raised visors with\\nthe right hand when meeting a comrade. This practice\\ngradually became a way of showing respect and in early\\nAmerican history sometimes involved removing the hat. By\\n1820, the motion was modified to touching the hat, and\\nsince then has become the hand salute used today.\\nWhile in the Army, you salute to show respect toward an\\nofficer, flag, or our country. The proper way to salute with or\\nwithout a weapon is described in Training Circular 3-21.5.\\nSee AR 600-25, for when to salute.\\nFollow these rules:\\nWhen you meet someone outside, salute as soon as you\\nrecognize that they are an officer, or if you are walking\\ntoward the officer, wait until you are about six steps away.\\nSalute all officers (recognized by rank) in official vehicles\\nidentified by special plates or flags.\\nSalute only on command when in a formation.\\nIf in a group and an officer approaches, the first Soldier to\\nrecognize the officer calls the group to attention and all\\npersonnel salute.\\n93TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nIf you approach an officer while you are double-timing alone,\\nassume quick time, render the hand salute and give the\\nproper greeting. When the salute is returned, execute order\\narms and resume double-time.\\nThe salute is always initiated by the subordinate and\\nterminated only after acknowledgment by the individual\\nsaluted.\\nAccompany the salute with an appropriate greeting, such\\nas, \"good morning/afternoon, sir /ma\\'am.\"\\nSalutes are not required to be rendered by or to personnel\\nwho are driving or riding in privately owned vehicles.\\nIt is not customary for enlisted personnel to exchange\\nsalutes, except in some ceremonial situations.\\nNever render a salute with a noticeable object in your mouth\\nor right hand.\\nIf you are on detail and an officer approaches, salute if you\\nare in charge of the detail. Otherwise, continue to work.\\nWhen spoken to, come to the position of attention while\\naddressing an officer.\\nHand salute\\nThe Hand Salute is a one-count movement. The command\\nis \u201cPresent, ARMS\u201d. The Hand Salute may be executed\\nwhile marching. When marching, only the Soldier in charge\\nof the formation salutes.\\n94TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 6-1. Hand salute\\nWhen wearing headgear with a visor (with or without\\nglasses), on the command of execution ARMS, raise the\\nright hand sharply, fingers and thumb extended and joined,\\npalm facing down, and place the tip of the right forefinger on\\nthe rim of the visor slightly to the right of the right eye. The\\nouter edge of the hand is barely canted downward so that\\nneither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible\\nfrom the front. The hand and wrist are straight, the elbow\\ninclined slightly forward, and the upper arm horizontal.\\nWhen wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and\\nnot wearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute in the same\\nmanner as previously described, except touch the tip of the\\nright forefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right\\nof the right eyebrow.\\nWhen wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and\\nwearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute in the same\\nmanner as previously described, except touch the tip of the\\nright forefinger to that point on the glasses where the temple\\npiece of the frame meets the right edge of the right brow.\\n95TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nOrder Arms\\nOrder Arms from the Hand Salute is a one-count movement.\\nThe command is \u201cOrder, ARMS\u201d. On the command of\\nexecution ARMS, return the hand sharply to the side,\\nresuming the Position of Attention.\\nWhen reporting or rendering courtesy to an individual, turn\\nthe head and eyes toward the person addressed and\\nsimultaneously salute. In this situation, the actions are\\nexecuted without command. The Salute is initiated by the\\nsubordinate at the appropriate time (six paces) and\\nterminated upon acknowledgment.\\nRendering customs and courtesies to NCOs and\\nWarrant Officers\\nWhen addressing an NCO you need to be at the position of\\nParade Rest. The NCO may direct you to at ease, stand at\\nease, or rest.\\nWhen walking with someone of higher rank, walk on the left\\nside of the individual.\\nAlways greet individuals with the greeting of the day. Be\\nrespectful at all times.\\nWarrant Officers are treated in the same respect as Officers.\\nRendering Honor to the Flag\\nThe flag of the U.S. is the symbol of our Nation. The union,\\nwhite stars on a field of blue, is the honor point of the flag.\\nThe union of the flag and the flag itself, when in company\\nwith other flags, is always given the honor position; such as,\\nthe marching right, the flag\u2019s own right, or an observer\u2019s left\\nwhen facing the flag.\\n96TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe flag of the U.S. is displayed outdoors at all Army\\ninstallations.\\nThe flag is displayed daily from reveille to retreat. If\\nilluminated, it may be displayed at night during special\\nevents or on special occasions deemed appropriate by the\\ncommander.\\nWhen the flag is raised in the morning or lowered in the\\nevening, stand at attention on the first note of Reveille or\\n\"To the Colors.\u201d \"Colors\" refers to the flag of the U.S. and\\ncan include the unit flag. Give the required salute. You\\nnormally face the flag when saluting unless duty requires\\nyou to face in some other direction. At the conclusion of the\\nceremony, resume your regular duties.\\nThe flag, when flown at half-staff, is hoisted to the peak/top\\nof the flagpole and then lowered to the half-staff position. At\\nthe end of the day, the flag is hoisted to the peak before\\nlowered. \"Half-staff\" means lowering the flag to one-half the\\ndistance between the top and bottom of the staff.\\nWhenever Reveille or To the Colors are played, and you are\\nnot in formation and not in a vehicle, come to attention at\\nthe first note, face the flag, and give the required salute. If\\nno flag is near, face the music and salute. If you are in\\nformation, salute only on the order \"Present arms.\u201d If you are\\nin civilian clothing, stand at attention and place your right\\nhand over your heart.\\nCourtesies\\nThe following rules will help you conduct yourself\\nappropriately in the presence of officers and those senior in\\nrank:\\n97TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nWhen talking to an Officer or Warrant Officer, stand at\\nattention unless given the order \"At ease\u201d. When you are\\ndismissed, or when the officer departs, come to attention\\nand salute.\\nWhen an officer enters a room, the first Soldier to recognize\\nthe officer calls personnel in the room to attention but does\\nnot salute. When indoors a Soldier only renders a salute\\nwhen reporting to the officer or part of a ceremony requiring\\nsaluting.\\nWhen accompanying a senior, walk on his left.\\nWhen an officer enters a dining facility, unless he directs\\notherwise or a more senior officer is already present, the\\ndiners will be given the order \"At ease\" by the first person\\nwho sees the officer. You will remain seated at ease and\\ncontinue eating unless the officer directs otherwise. If you\\nare directly addressed, you should rise to attention when\\nseated in a chair. If you are seated on a bench, stop eating\\nand sit at attention until the conversation ends.\\nNote: The officer or NCO may give the directive \"Carry on.\u201d\\nThis means the Soldier or Soldiers should continue with\\nwhatever they were doing previously. This same directive is\\nused in many other situations outside of formation, such as\\nin the barracks and break areas.\\nWhen outdoors and approached by an NCO, you should\\nstand (when seated) and greet the NCO by saying, \"good\\nmorning, sergeant,\" \"good afternoon, sergeant,\" or \"good\\nevening, sergeant (last name, if known).\"\\nWhile going through BCT, you will address all drill sergeants\\nas \u201cDrill Sergeant\u201d.\\n98TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nWhen you report to an officer and you are outdoors,\\napproach the officer, stop about two steps from him/her, and\\nassume the position of attention. Give the proper salute and\\nsay, for example, \"Sir/Ma\\'am, Private Smith reports.\u201d If you\\nare indoors, use the same procedures as above, except\\nremove your headgear before reporting.\\n6-3. Bugle Calls\\nBugle calls are the musical signals that announce scheduled\\nand certain non-scheduled events on an Army installation.\\nScheduled calls are prescribed by the installation\\ncommander. According to Army customs, bugle calls\\ntraditionally signal troops for everything from mealtimes and\\nrecall formations, to rendering honors to the nation. Bugle\\ncalls normally sound in accordance with the major calls of\\nthe day-Reveille, Retreat, and Taps.\\nReveille\\nThe call signals the troops to awaken for morning roll call.\\nMost often heard at physical training, it is used to\\naccompany the raising of the National Colors. If outdoors at\\nthe first sound of Reveille, you should come to the position\\nof attention and salute, facing the flag or the sound of the\\nmusic. If not in uniform, come to attention and place your\\nright hand over your heart.\\nRetreat\\nThe call signals the end of the duty day and lowering of the\\nNational Colors. If alone, you should come to attention in the\\ndirection of the music or flag. Then, salute when you hear\\nthe first note of music after the cannon sounds. If not in\\n99TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nuniform, come to attention and place your right hand over\\nyour heart.\\nTaps\\nThe call signals that unauthorized lights are to be\\nextinguished. It is the last call of the day. If indoors there is\\nno need to stand at attention and salute. The call is also\\nsounded at the completion of a military funeral ceremony.\\nYou should come to attention and salute until the music\\ncompletes. If not in uniform, come to attention and place\\nyour right hand over your heart.\\n6-4. Drill and Ceremonies\\nMany drill procedures used by the U.S. Army today were\\ndeveloped during the Revolutionary War. The purpose of\\nthe drill then was to instill discipline in American Soldiers. As\\nthese Soldiers mastered the art of the drill, they began to\\nwork as a team and develop a sense of pride in themselves\\nand in their unit.\\nIn today\\'s Army, the same objectives\u2013teamwork,\\nconfidence, pride, alertness, attention to detail, esprit de\\ncorps, and discipline are accomplished by drill.\\nA drill consists of a series of movements by which a unit or\\nindividuals are moved in an orderly, uniform manner from\\none formation or place to another. Units vary in size, but in\\nBCT, you will ordinarily be part of a squad, platoon,\\ncompany, or battalion.\\nStrengthen Soldier proficiency with Army customs and\\ncourtesies and continue to enculturate pride in discipline\\nwithin the force.\\n100TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nYou will need to know the following drill terms:\\nElement is an individual, squad, section, platoon, company,\\nor larger unit formed as part of the next higher unit.\\nFormation is an arrangement of the unit\\'s elements in a\\nprescribed manner such as a line formation in which the\\nelements are side-by-side, or a column formation in which\\nthe elements are one behind the other. In a platoon column,\\nthe members of each squad are one behind the other with\\nthe squads abreast.\\nFront is a space from one side to the other side of a\\nformation and includes the right and left elements.\\nDepth is a space from the front to the rear of a formation,\\nincluding the front and rear elements.\\nDistance is the space between elements that are one\\nbehind the other. The distance between individuals is an\\n(914.4 mm) arm\\'s length, plus 6 inches (152.4 mm), or\\n101TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\napproximately 36 inches (914.4 mm) measured from the\\nchest of one Soldier to the back of the Soldier immediately\\nto his front.\\nInterval is the space between side-by-side elements.\\nRank is a line that is only one element in depth.\\nFile is a column that has a front of one element.\\nGuide is the person responsible for maintaining the\\nprescribed direction and rate of march.\\nPost is the correct place for an officer or NCO to stand in a\\nprescribed formation.\\nHead is a column\\'s leading element. Base is the element.\\nCadence is a uniform rhythm or number of steps or counts\\nper minute.\\nQuick Time is a cadence of 120 counts (steps per minute)\\naround which a movement is planned or regulated.\\nDouble Time is a cadence of 180 counts (steps per\\nminute).\\nDrill commands are oral orders given by your commander\\nor leader, usually in two parts. The preparatory command\\nstates the movement to be carried out and gets you ready to\\nexecute the order. The command of execution tells when\\nthe movement is to be carried out. In the command\\n\u201cForward, march,\u201d the preparatory command is \u201cForward,\u201d\\nthe command of execution is \u201cMarch.\u201d\\n102TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 6-2. Drill and ceremony position\\nIn some commands, the preparatory command and the\\ncommand of execution are combined. For example, \u201cfall in,\u201d\\n\u201cat ease,\u201d and \u201crest.\u201d These commands are given without\\ninflection and at a uniformly high pitch and loudness\\ncomparable to that of a normal command of execution.\\nIf you are in a group of three or more, marching is required\\nwhen moving from one location to another.\\n103TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMost marching movements are a five-step process. This can\\nbe simplified into the acronym PICAA:\\nP-preparatory command\\nI-intermediate step\\nC-command of execution\\nA-action step\\nA-additional step.\\nPut simply, the Preparatory command, the command of\\nexecution and the action step\u2014executing the movement\u2014\\nare all given or executed when the same foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. The Intermediate step and Additional step\\nare executed with the other foot.\\nChapter 7 \u2013 Physical Readiness\\nThe Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System recognizes\\nthat Soldier readiness depends on the proper combinations\\nof physical fitness (such as strength, speed, and endurance)\\nand foundational health (such as the cardiovascular,\\nrespiratory, immune, and hormonal systems) that are\\noptimized through careful attention to nutritional readiness,\\nmental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness.\\nNutrition\u2014the food, beverages, and supplements in a\\nSoldier\u2019s diet\u2014provides the nutrients needed to meet the\\nphysical demands of training and combat. Soldiers must\\nalso maintain mental readiness\u2014the exceptional mental\\n104TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nflexibility and endurance, outstanding self-initiative and\\nsuperior judgment required in combat. Spiritual readiness\\nsupports individual and collective readiness as Soldiers\\nnegotiate challenging moral and ethical situations in training\\nor operational environments. Finally, proper sleep sustains\\nbrain function, cognition (thought processing), the immune\\nsystem, and recovery after physical activity.\\n7-1. Army Physical Fitness Uniform (APFU)\\nThe components of the APFU are:\\n1. Jacket, running, black and gold.\\n2. Pants, running, black.\\n3. Trunks, running, black, moisture-wicking.\\n4. T-shirt, black, short sleeve, moisture-wicking.\\n5. T-shirt, black, long sleeve, moisture-wicking.\\n6.

Performance Nutrition\\nThe Army\u2019s Holistic Health and Fitness System (H2F)\\nhighlights Nutritional Readiness as a key component to\\nSoldier performance (FM 7-22). Nutritional readiness is the\\nability to recognize, select, and consume the necessary\\nfoods and fluids to meet the physical and nonphysical\\ndemands of any duty or combat position, accomplish the\\nmission, and come home healthy.\\nFuel your body for optimal performance\\nAs a Soldier athlete, you are expected to achieve and\\nmaintain a high level of fitness and readiness. Fitness is\\nnot only achieved by your training, but also how you fuel\\n(with food) and hydrate (with fluid) your body. Fueling\\nwith performance limiting foods (such as \u201cjunk\u201d foods or\\nmost vending machine items, regular sodas, energy\\ndrinks, most fast-food options, fried foods, etc.) leads to\\nmental and physical fatigue and could contribute to\\ninjuries and illnesses.\\nOptimal fueling requires a little knowledge, a little\\ndiscipline, and a whole lot of dedication to caring for the\\nArmy\u2019s most important weapons system\u2014YOU!\\nFueling with the right amount of carbohydrates, protein,\\nand healthful fats promotes energy, endurance, stamina,\\nand muscle growth. Benefits of proper fueling include:\\n\u2022 Maintaining a lean body composition\\n111TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Decreasing post-exercise muscle soreness\\n\u2022 Stronger and healthier muscles\\nFigure 8-1.

Iron\\nmakes it possible for cells to carry oxygen to the body\\'s\\ntissues. When iron levels are low, you may feel weak, tired,\\nand irritable. The best sources of iron are the foods you eat.\\nMost female trainees and athletes do not consume\\nenough iron to meet their nutritional needs. Thus,\\nhealthcare providers will provide female trainees with a\\nprescription for a daily MVI (prenatal vitamin). Taking\\nthe MVI is voluntary, but highly recommended. Benefits\\nof a MVI may include:\\nImproved energy during training.\\nImproved physical fitness performance.\\nIncreased likelihood of on-time graduation.\\nImproved concentration.\\nWhy are males not given the MVI?\\nMost men have 4-5 times the amount of\\nrecommended iron stores and can manage the\\nincreased iron demand of basic combat training with\\nfood alone.\\n118TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 8-4. Multivitamin with Iron content and size\\nStay hydrated\\nFluid needs vary greatly from person to person, and\\ndepend on intensity of work, level of heat stress, and\\nsweat rates.\\nThe first step in hydration is to drink fluids and eat foods high\\nin water content throughout the day.\\nCool water is the beverage of choice for maintaining\\nhydration. Recommended fluid intake ranges from 2 to 5\\nquarts (64-160 ounces) per day. For reference, a\\ncanteen holds 1 quart of fluid, an issued hydration pack\\nholds ~3 quarts.\\n\u2022 Drink regularly or whenever possible during\\nexercise, training, and operations. Drink 16\u201332\\nounces of fluid every 60 minutes during activity\\nto stay hydrated.\\n\u2022 Performance declines with slight dehydration.\\n119TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 To rehydrate (replace fluids) after exercise, drink\\nliquids and eat foods that contain fluids. Consume\\nabout 20\u201324 ounces of fluid for every pound of\\nweight you lost.\\n\u2022 Drinking too much plain water or not consuming\\nenough sodium can lead to hyponatremia (low\\nsodium levels in your blood), a potentially serious\\ncondition.\\nElectrolytes control the fluid balance of the body and are\\nimportant in muscle contraction, among many other\\nessential functions. Electrolytes (sodium, potassium,\\ncalcium, magnesium, and chloride) are found in food and\\nfluids. The loss of sodium and potassium in sweat can be\\nquite high during prolonged physical activity, especially in\\nwarm weather. It\u2019s important to choose foods and\\nbeverages that contain sodium and other electrolytes to\\npromote faster and more complete recovery. Drinking too\\nmuch plain water or not consuming enough sodium can\\nresult in hyponatremia (low sodium levels in your blood),\\nwhich requires immediate medical attention to reduce risk of\\nserious illness or death.\\nHyponatremia typically occurs during physical activities of\\nlonger duration. Symptoms, which can be severe, include\\nheadache, vomiting, swollen hands and feet, fatigue,\\nconfusion, disorientation, and breathing problems. Keep in\\nmind that some symptoms of hyponatremia are similar to\\nthe symptoms of dehydration, so be mindful of how much\\nand how often you drink fluids.

During your first void (or\\nurination) of the day, if you see that your urine is dark, you\\nneed to drink more fluids or eat more foods with a high-\\nwater content. Recommended fluids: water, sports drinks,\\n100% fruit juice, milk, milk alternatives (soy, almond).\\nRecommended foods: fruits and vegetables, soup, yogurt\\n121TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 8-5.

Energy drinks generally contain\\nlarge quantities of caffeine and may contain other\\ningredients, most of which do absolutely nothing to enhance\\nperformance or health. Also, the large quantities of caffeine\\ncan aggravate dehydration, and may lead to increased\\nanxiety, upset stomach, shakiness, headaches, and sleep\\nissues.\\nThese potential side effects can reduce your ability to\\nperform, NOT enhance it. Instead of reaching for energy\\ndrinks, it\u2019s best to feed your body energy throughout the\\nday:\\n\u2022 Snack on carbohydrates and energy-rich foods such\\nas dried fruits, nuts, trail mix, a commercial sports\\nbar or low-fat chocolate milk.\\n\u2022 Drink cool, plain water frequently, even if you aren\u2019t\\nthirsty.\\nDietary supplements\\nMany Soldiers use dietary supplements to improve\\nperformance, increase muscle mass, enhance energy,\\naccelerate recovery, increase alertness, boost their immune\\nsystem, and improve joint function. However, dietary\\nsupplements are not tested or approved by the Food and\\nDrug Administration prior to placement on the market, are\\noften unnecessary, and can be dangerous and expensive.\\n123TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nAlthough some dietary supplements can offer some\\nbenefits, others might be unsafe or contaminated with\\ndrugs, controlled substances, or other ingredients not\\nlisted on the label.

Sleep\\nThe disciplined practices in sleep, activity, and nutrition\\ncomprise the Army\u2019s \u201cperformance triad.\u201d By following the\\nhabits outlined below you maximize performance and avoid\\nillness and injury.\\nMake Sleep A Priority - Sleep is a biological need for brain\\nfunctioning and is critical to sustain the mental abilities\\nrequired for success in BCT and advanced individual\\ntraining. Soldiers require a minimum of 7-8 hours of sleep\\nevery 24-hours.\\nIn BCT, you can receive at least 7 hours of continuous sleep\\nper night (unless you are scheduled for duty such as access\\ncontrol guard/fireguard or charge of quarter\u2019s runner).\\nDuring field training, the length of the training day, and time\\nfor sleep will vary based on training requirements; however,\\nyour commander will ensure that the schedule allows\\nsufficient time for sleep during field training.\\nThe MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU MUST REMEMBER:\\nWhen you can sleep, do it. Insufficient sleep presents a risk\\nto mission success. Sleep deprived Soldiers are likely to\\nmake mission critical and sometimes fatal errors.\\n126TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe demanding nature of military operations often creates\\nsituations in which obtaining enough sleep on a regular\\nbasis is difficult or impossible. Such chronic, insufficient\\nsleep (anything less than 7-8 hours per 24 hours) produces\\na sleep debt \u2013 a chronic state of increased sleep need that\\nis characterized by impaired performance and readiness.\\nThe only way to eliminate the debt is to obtain sleep (just\\nclosing your eyes and resting is not the same as\\nsleeping/napping). As a Soldier you must make sleep a\\npriority!\\nWhen you can rest or sleep, do it.\\n8-3. Activity\\nDuring BCT you will obviously maintain a high level of\\nactivity. However, once you graduate from AIT or OSUT,\\nyou have much more control over your level of activity. You\\nwill need recreational-type activities to maintain your\\noptimum performance; Army physical readiness training and\\nthe other high-physical demands of your duties will not\\nprovide all the physical activity you need.\\nPhysical activity is more than just \u201cexercise\u201d or \u201cworking\\nout\u201d- it\u2019s living an active lifestyle. Whether it\u2019s walking the\\ndog, doing yard work, or playing with your kids, regular\\nmovement throughout the day inspires positive health\\noutcomes over time.\\nPhysical activity improves health in the following ways:\\n\u2022 Lowers risk of some chronic diseases and\\nconditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood\\npressure, stroke, and cancer (for example, breast\\nand colon).\\n127TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Aids in weight loss and prevents weight gain.\\n\u2022 Helps manage stress and may reduce depression.\\n\u2022 Strengthens bones, muscles, and joints.\\n\u2022 Boosts confidence and self-esteem.\\nAmount and types of physical activity. To receive positive\\nhealth outcomes, you need at least:\\n\u2022 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity\\nper week. 150 minutes is also: 2 hours and 30\\nminutes per week OR 30 minutes a day for 5 days\\nOR 10 minutes of activity 3 times a day for 5 days.\\n\u2022 2 days of muscle strengthening activities (like\\nweight/resistance band training, calisthenics, and\\nyoga).\\n\u2022 10,000 steps during your everyday routine. Note:\\n10,000 steps is close to 5 miles. An inactive person\\nmay only average 1,000 to 3,000 steps a day, or\\nabout one mile. Persons who walk less than this in a\\nnormal day should add walking to their routines.\\nSave time by bumping up the intensity. Perform 75 minutes\\nof vigorous-intensity activities per week (jogging, swimming\\nlaps, or hiking uphill).\\n\u2022 Pick activities you enjoy. Moderate-intensity\\nactivities include: brisk walking, doubles tennis, golf,\\nand leisure biking.\\n\u2022 Invite Family, friends, and fellow Soldiers to join\\nyou. Take a fitness class, join a recreation league,\\nsign up for a 5K run/walk, or start a walking group in\\nyour neighborhood.\\n128TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n8-4. Hygiene\\nIn addition to Army training, personal hygiene plays a crucial\\nrole in your overall physical readiness as a strong,\\nproductive Soldier. There are numerous health concerns\\nthat can arise if you do not conduct proper personal hygiene\\nat home and in field environments.\\nHazard of communicable diseases\\nCommunicable diseases are caused by specific infectious\\norganisms like viruses or bacteria transmitted from one\\nperson to another. The person who is infected may feel\\nand/or look sick or might carry the illness without feeling or\\nlooking sick at all. These diseases can rapidly degrade the\\nmedical readiness of Soldiers and entire military units\\npreventing them from achieving their mission. They also\\ncause significant suffering and overwhelm the military health\\ncare system.\\nYou received vaccinations to protect you against the\\nincreased risk of these infections when you entered the\\nArmy, and you will receive additional vaccinations prior to\\ntravel to foreign areas. There are many communicable\\nillnesses that do not have vaccines such as the common\\ncold and hepatitis C and D.\\nResistance to illness\\nVaccines do part of the job; the rest is up to you. Your\\nimmune system protects you from most illnesses. It\\ncontinues with things you do to protect yourself, like keeping\\nyourself and the environment clean; wearing a clean uniform\\nappropriate for the season; and avoiding contact with\\npersons who are ill. Also, you should always cough into your\\n129TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\narm and clean your hands frequently to avoid\\nspreading/receiving germs.\\nImmediate hazards to your health\\nDo not take chances with your health. If in doubt, get\\nmedical help. Injuries that pose a threat to your health or life\\nare:\\n\u2022 Any eye injury.\\n\u2022 Any human or animal bite that breaks the skin.\\n\u2022 Allergic reaction to an insect bite, chemicals, or\\nmedications.\\n\u2022 Bleeding that cannot be stopped.\\n\u2022 Burns, including severe sunburn.\\n\u2022 Feeling very hot and/or confused after being out in\\nthe heat.\\n\u2022 Exposure to cold temperatures and you think you\\nmay have a cold injury.\\nOther symptoms of illnesses that can threaten your health or\\nlife include:\\n\u2022 Tightness, pressure, or pain in your chest that\\nspreads to your neck, jaw, arm, or back.\\n\u2022 Shortness of breath or wheezing while resting.\\n\u2022 Difficulty breathing, or the feeling of choking.\\n\u2022 Coughing up blood.\\n\u2022 Difficulty speaking, swallowing, or opening your\\nmouth.\\n130TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Stiff neck with fever.\\n\u2022 Sudden loss of vision.\\n\u2022 Very bad pain anywhere on your body.\\n\u2022 Weakness and dizziness.\\n\u2022 Blood in your urine or brown urine.\\n\u2022 Vomiting up blood or what looks like coffee grounds.\\n\u2022 Blood in your stool or black, tar-like stools.\\n\u2022 You feel like you might hurt yourself or others.\\n\u2022 Hip or knee injuries.\\n\u2022 Painful teeth or swelling in your mouth or jaw.\\nIf you experience any injuries or symptoms of illness, report\\nthem to your drill sergeant immediately to receive health\\ncare.\\nBathe/shower daily\\nRegular bathing with soap and water is important for both\\ncleanliness and personal appearance.\\nBathing prevents hygiene-related diseases such as scabies,\\nringworm, athlete\u2019s foot, skin infections, and pink eye.\\nYou should wash your hands, face and ears, armpits, groin,\\nand feet. In addition to washing your skin regularly you\\nshould wash your hair at least twice a week, shave daily and\\navoid sharing combs or razors with others.\\nWash hands regularly\\nNormally your immune system protects you against invasion\\nby bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, if your hands\\n131TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nbecome contaminated with these organisms and you put\\nthem up to your nose or mouth, disease and germs can\\ninvade your body and cause an infection.\\nMany aspects of basic training can make you more\\nvulnerable to respiratory illnesses to include close contact\\nwith other Soldiers.\\nThe physical and psychological stresses of military training\\ncan make you more vulnerable to illness. In addition, your\\nimmune system may not be able to withstand the new\\norganisms you are exposed to when first brought together\\nas a group.\\nAlmost 90 percent of Soldiers get symptoms of respiratory\\nillness at some point during BCT. In most cases, these\\nillnesses are mild, and trainees can continue training, but\\nsometimes they progress to worse infections like pneumonia\\nor meningitis.\\nWashing your hands with soap and water is the most\\neffective way to prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses\\nwhich are major cause of food borne diseases and other\\nillnesses. Although the use of hand sanitizers is effective for\\nkilling most of these harmful organisms on the hands, they\\nare ineffective on hands that are heavily soiled with dirt,\\ngrease, and other debris. Therefore, the use of hand\\nsanitizers should not be used in place of hand washing,\\nrather as a supplement to or a temporary alternative when\\nhand washing is not available.\\nWash or sanitize your hands every time:\\n\u2022 After using the latrine\\n\u2022 Before eating or handling food\\n132TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 After sneezing or blowing your nose\\nIt is important to practice good hygiene habits when you are\\nin basic training. It becomes more difficult to wash your\\nhands and bathe regularly when you are in the field or\\ndeployed.\\nDental health and readiness\\nBrush and floss your teeth.\\nKeeping a healthy mouth maintains dental readiness and\\nensures you will not suffer from pain, infection, or inability to\\neat high-performance foods. Poor oral health takes more\\nSoldiers out of the fight than the enemy does.\\nWisdom teeth and gum disease cause problems. However\\nmost dental emergencies are caused by tooth decay or its\\ncomplications.\\nTooth decay is caused by bacteria (germs) that feed on\\nstarchy or sugary snacks and beverages, and by acids that\\nwear away the surfaces of teeth. Soda, juice, sweet tea,\\nsports drinks, and energy drinks all contain sugar and acids\\nthat can damage teeth.\\nSaliva is critical for protecting your teeth from decay by\\nneutralizing acids, hardening teeth, and fighting germs.\\nStressful training or operations can decrease saliva flow,\\nleaving you vulnerable to decay.\\nPrevent dental problems in three ways: watch what you put\\nin your mouth, wear mouth guards during training activities,\\nand clean your mouth every day.\\n133TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFollow the guidelines in the Nutrition section above and\\ncontribute toward a healthy mouth.\\nYour teeth and gums need the same water intake, calcium,\\nvitamins and minerals, and protein that the rest of your body\\nneeds as well as protection from sugars, acid content, and\\nsimple starches. Do not sip them throughout the day.\\nIn addition to a healthy diet:\\n\u2022 Limit sugary drinks. If you have them, drink them in\\none setting with a straw and rinse out with water\\nafterwards.\\n\u2022 Rinse your mouth with plain water after drinking\\nsugary drinks.\\n\u2022 If you drink juice, choose juice that has calcium\\nadded to minimize acid damage.\\n\u2022 Use sugar free gum or mints.\\n\u2022 Avoid tobacco. Tobacco can cause gum disease\\nand oral cancer.\\n\u2022 Use lip balm with sunscreen during sun exposure to\\nprevent lip cancer.\\nClean your mouth every day:\\n\u2022 Brush 2-3 times a day, every day, with fluoride\\ntoothpaste to remove food particles and harmful\\nbacteria from your teeth. Fluoride helps repair early-\\nstage tooth decay and makes tooth structure more\\nresistant to tooth decay.\\n\u2022 Brush before going to sleep to provide greater\\nprotection for your teeth.\\n134TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Use a soft or ultra-soft toothbrush that is small\\nenough to fit around your back teeth.\\n\u2022 Brush your teeth for about 2-3 minutes using a\\ngentle, circular motion. Pay extra attention to the\\ngum-line, back teeth, and areas around fillings,\\ncrowns, or bridges.\\n\u2022 Brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth to\\nremove germs that cause tooth decay and bad\\nbreath.\\n\u2022 If you have an appliance such as an orthodontic\\nretainer or partial denture, remove it before brushing\\nyour teeth. Brush all surfaces of the appliance also.\\n\u2022 Do not rinse your mouth after brushing. Just spit\\nseveral times to remove excess toothpaste.\\n\u2022 Don\u2019t eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes\\nafter you brush so the fluoride will stay on your teeth\\nlonger and protect them better.\\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t brush:\\nSwish with water after eating or drinking.\\no\\nWipe your teeth with a clean cloth wrapped\\no\\naround your finger.\\nRub toothpaste on the surfaces of your teeth\\no\\nwith your finger.\\n\u2022 Floss once a day. Flossing removes bacteria and\\nfood in between teeth and areas a toothbrush can\u2019t\\nreach.\\n135TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Use 18 inches (457.2 mm) of floss. Wrap the end of\\nthe floss around your middle finger and use your\\nindex finger to guide the floss.\\n\u2022 Insert the floss between your teeth. Gently pull from\\nside to side to get it through the tight spots, Use a\\ndifferent area of the floss for each space.\\n\u2022 Gently move the floss up and down against the\\ntooth in back, then the tooth in front.\\n\u2022 Wrap the floss around the teeth as you\u2019re moving it\\nup and down gently.\\n\u2022 Your gums may bleed at first when you start flossing\\nevery day. If bleeding continues after a week or two\\nsee your dentist.\\nRemember, you can minimize the risk for cavities. When a\\ndentist identifies a problem at your annual exam, get it\\ntreated as soon as possible.\\nNote: Females should be extra vigilant about brushing with\\nfluoride toothpaste 2-3 times a day to prevent cavities and\\nbleeding gums.\\nFemales tend to make less saliva than males which leaves\\nthem more vulnerable to tooth decay.\\nFluctuations in female hormones can also negatively affect\\noral health. Hormones and oral contraceptives can increase\\nbacteria levels in the mouth and cause changes in the blood\\nvessels in the gums, leading to gingivitis.\\nFemale hormones impact the mouth\u2019s reaction to bacteria\\nand can increase bacteria symptoms during monthly\\n136TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nhormonal fluctuations resulting in tenderness, swelling, and\\nbleeding when brushing.\\nFemales who use oral contraceptives are also twice as likely\\nto develop a painful condition called \u201cdry socket\u201d after dental\\nextraction.\\nHormone fluctuations and stressful environments are\\nassociated with development of painful mouth ulcers or\\ncanker sores.\\nNutritional deficiencies (vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, C, folate,\\niron, magnesium, or zinc) may also increase your risk of\\ndeveloping mouth ulcers.\\nOver-the-counter remedies are effective for the discomfort\\ncaused by small ulcers and can be obtained at dental sick\\ncall. Larger or more painful ulcers may interfere with a\\nnormal diet.\\nA dentist can prescribe medicine to reduce pain and\\naccelerate healing of larger ulcers.\\nCare for your feet and nails\\nAthlete\u2019s foot is caused by a fungus that lives in damp,\\nwarm, and dark areas like shower rooms, rubber boots, and\\nin some cases, older or poorly maintained running shoes.\\nAthlete\u2019s foot usually looks like small blisters between the\\ntoes. These can pop, causing itching and little sharp pains.\\nThe skin may crack or look scaly.\\nYou can get athlete\u2019s foot from walking barefoot on unclean\\nfacilities and not washing your feet.\\n137TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe symptoms include itching, flaking skin, and cracking\\nbetween toes or on bottom of feet.\\nDo the following to prevent Athlete\u2019s foot:\\n\u2022 Wear shower shoes when taking showers and\\nwalking on the floor.\\n\u2022 Use a towel to dry thoroughly between your toes.\\n\u2022 Wear clean dry socks; never wear another Soldier\u2019s\\nsocks.\\n\u2022 Clean the showers and latrine floors daily.\\n\u2022 Sprinkle foot powder in your socks to help absorb\\nthe moisture.\\n\u2022 Remove the inserts from your boots at night to\\nprevent fungus from growing.\\nIf you get athlete\u2019s foot, an anti-fungal solution or cream is\\nneeded to treat it.\\nAlternate your boots daily. Wear one pair of boots one day\\nand change to your other pair the next day.\\nIn addition to preventing athlete\u2019s foot, make sure you\\nprevent ingrown toenails. Ingrown toenails are caused by a\\ncombination of tight shoes and trimming the toenails down\\nto the edge of the nail.\\nSymptoms include tenderness, swelling, sharp pain,\\nredness, and discharge.\\nYou can prevent ingrown toenails by trimming nails straight\\nacross every two weeks. Cut toenails short and square.\\n138TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSeek medical attention for treatment for ingrown nails.\\nSurgery may be necessary to remove the nail from the skin.\\nPrevent blisters\\nBlisters are caused by friction from tight fitting shoes,\\nbreaking in new boots, and/or road marches.\\nSymptoms are redness and tenderness of the skin.\\nBlisters can be minimized.\\nWearing proper fitting boots and tight fitting, clean, dry\\nsocks free of excessive wear can prevent most blisters.\\nSecond skin (mole skin) on \u201chot spots,\u201d knee-high nylons,\\nand good personal hygiene reduces blisters as well.\\nTo prevent blisters on the hands, wear work gloves when\\noperating equipment that requires repetitive movements,\\nsuch as raking or shoveling.\\nTake the following measures to treat a blister:\\n\u2022 Wash with a mild soap and water. Keep your skin\\nclean and dry. Apply a topical anti-biotic ointment to\\nprevent infection.\\n\u2022 Cover with bandage or second skin to prevent from\\nopening.\\n\u2022 DO NOT purposely open a blister.\\n\u2022 If blister opens, treat as you would any open cut.\\n\u2022 Always leave the top skin of a drained blister.\\n\u2022 Pulling off the top layer of skin can damage the new\\nskin underneath and cause infection.\\n139TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nProtect your hearing\\nSurvival on the battlefield could depend on your ability to\\nhear. Hearing loss caused by noise is painless, progressive,\\npermanent, but also preventable.\\nTo protect your hearing, insert your earplugs correctly\\nwhenever instructed to wear them.\\nDo not lose your earplugs. If you do lose your earplugs,\\nnotify your drill sergeant immediately to obtain another pair.\\nAlways wear your earplugs to protect your hearing when\\naround loud noises such as generators and\\nweapons/ranges.\\nProtect against the effects of heat, cold and insects\\nWhile in BCT and AIT, you may become exposed to\\nextreme heat, cold, and biting insects. To protect you from\\nthe effects of heat, cold, and insects your cadre will ensure\\nthe following:\\n\u2022 Safeguards against over-stress from heat, or over-\\nexposure to cold, especially in your first couple\\nweeks of training.\\n\u2022 Water and other beverages, and nutritious meals.\\nYou will likely drink more water and beverages than\\naccustomed.\\n\u2022 Protective clothing and sunscreen, and insect\\nrepellent. Your uniform is factory-treated with a\\nconventional insect repellent for clothing.\\n140TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Instructions on what items of your uniform to wear,\\nand how much water you should drink on a given\\nday.\\n\u2022 Reminders about symptoms and signs of hot and\\ncold weather illnesses to watch for in both you and\\nyour buddy.\\n\u2022 Questions on illnesses or if you are taking\\nmedication that may increases the risk of heat and\\ncold weather illness.\\nNote: In case of a severe hot weather illness, your cadre\\nmay remove the outer clothing and apply ice water-soaked\\nsheets to the affected Soldier, this is a potentially lifesaving\\nmeasure.\\nHere are a few things to remember all the time:\\n\u2022 Eat all your meals and drink all the water and\\nbeverages provided to you. Food and fluids are\\nneeded to \u201cfuel\u201d your body\u2019s regulating systems for\\nboth heat and cold.\\n\u2022 Make sure your uniform is clean, worn as instructed,\\nand all buttons and fasteners are serviceable. Apply\\nsunscreen and insect repellent to your face, neck,\\nand hands as instructed.\\n\u2022 Let your cadre know if you aren\u2019t feeling well, taking\\nmedications, and/or have unusual insect bite marks\\nthat look infected.

Ready and Resilient\\nSoldiers must cope with adversity, perform well in stressful\\nsituations, and learn to thrive in stressful environments.\\nThe ready and resilient Fitness program is designed to build\\nresilience and enhance the performance of the Army Family\\n\u2013 Soldiers, their Families, and Army Civilians \u2013 through\\nhands-on training and online self-development tools.\\nResilient individuals enhance Army performance and\\nreadiness. Resilience is the ability to grow and thrive in the\\nface of challenges and bounce back from adversity.\\nThe goal of ready and resilient Family Fitness is to increase\\nyour resilience and enhance your performance by\\ndeveloping and strengthening five dimensions of strength.\\n1. Social strength refers to developing and maintaining\\ntrusted, valued relationships and friendships that are\\npersonally fulfilling and foster good communication including\\na comfortable exchange of ideas, views, and experiences.\\n2. Emotional strength means approaching life\u2019s\\nchallenges in a positive, optimistic way by demonstrating\\nself-control, stamina, and good character with your choices\\nand actions.\\n3. Family strength is about being a part of a Family unit\\nthat is safe, supportive, loving, and provides the resources\\nneeded for all members to live in a healthy and secure\\nenvironment.\\n152TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n4. Spiritual strength refers to one\u2019s purpose, values,\\nbeliefs, identity, and life vision. These elements, which\\ndefine the essence of a person, enable one to build inner\\nstrength, make meaning of experiences, behave ethically,\\npersevere through challenges, and be resilient when faced\\nwith adversity. An individual\u2019s spirituality draws upon\\npersonal, philosophical, psychological, and/or religious\\nteachings, and forms the basis of their character.\\n5. Physical strength is about performing and excelling in\\nphysical activities that require aerobic fitness, endurance,\\nstrength, healthy body composition, and flexibility derived\\nthrough exercise, nutrition, and training. The physical\\ndimension also encompasses the Office of the Surgeon\\nGeneral (OTSG) Performance Triad initiative of sleep,\\nactivity, and nutrition to improve personal and unit\\nperformance, resilience, and readiness.\\n8-8. Chaplains\\nThe chaplain is responsible for providing spiritual support to\\nevery Soldier in the unit. Although chaplains are part of a\\nparticular denomination, their mission is to ensure the\\nspiritual needs of every Soldier are met. Each battalion in\\nthe Army has its own chaplain (normally a CPT). The\\nchaplains and their assistants form the Unit Ministry Team.\\nChaplains hold weekly services (while in garrison and in the\\nfield), are available for individual counseling, and are one of\\nthe few members of the military who retain the privilege of\\nconfidentiality. The chaplain also plays a key role to help\\npromote programs, such as suicide prevention.\\n153TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nIn the BCT/OSUT/AIT environment, they are of value in\\nhelping Soldiers succeed under difficult and stressful\\nconditions. They assist the commander in teaching,\\ndisplaying, and instilling the Army Values and with\\nmaintaining high morale within the unit.\\n8-9. Risk management\\nEvery Soldier, regardless of rank, is faced with making\\ndecisions. You will be challenged to make informed\\ndecisions that consider both risk, and potential benefit. Your\\ndecisions not only affect you, but also your team, family, and\\nfriends.\\nFigure 8-10. Risk management cycle\\nThe Army uses a process called Risk Management to help\\nmake those decisions. Army Techniques Publication 5-19,\\n154TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nRisk Management is the Army\u2019s doctrinal manual for risk\\nmanagement.\\nThe decision-making process doesn\u2019t just apply in combat; it\\napplies to everything you do on or off duty. The goal is to\\npreserve the Army\\'s ability to fight and win by avoiding\\nunnecessary risk and making informed decisions at every\\nlevel. The Army\u2019s Risk Management process is a logical\\napproach to risk-associated decision making that helps you\\nmake smart risk decisions and reduce the possibility of\\nlosses.\\nAs you progress throughout your career, you will learn more\\nabout the risk management process. A few of the hazards\\nyou may encounter during IET include:\\n\u2022 Hot weather injury\\n\u2022 Cold weather injury\\n\u2022 Weapon-related hazards\\n\u2022 Environmental hazards (insects, animals, poisonous\\nplants, etc.)\\n____________________________________________\\nChapter 9 \u2013 Discipline\\nThe Army is subject to military law and the laws of our\\ngovernment, and we strive to live as law-abiding Soldiers in\\nwhatever we do and wherever we go.\\nDiscipline is the practice of our profession in the conduct of\\nduty, ethically, effectively, and efficiently meeting standards\\nwhile striving for excellence.\\n155TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMilitary discipline is founded upon self-discipline, respect for\\nproperly constituted authority, and embracing the\\nprofessional Army Ethic with its supporting individual values.\\nMilitary discipline is instilled through positive leadership,\\nreinforcing the regulatory standards for personnel, and the\\ntraining readiness standards for individual and collective\\ntasks, together, resulting in a mental attitude about proper\\nconduct and obedience to lawful military authority.\\nWhile military discipline is the result of effective training, it is\\naffected by every feature of military life. It is manifested in\\nindividuals and units by:\\n\u2022 Cohesion, bonding, and a spirit of teamwork.\\n\u2022 Smartness of appearance and action.\\n\u2022 Cleanliness and maintenance of dress, equipment,\\nand quarters.\\n\u2022 Deference to seniors and mutual respect between\\nsenior and subordinate personnel.\\n\u2022 Prompt and willing execution of both the letter and\\nthe spirit of the legal orders of their lawful\\ncommanders.\\n\u2022 Fairness, justice, and equity for all Soldiers,\\nregardless of race, color, sex (including gender\\nidentity), national origin, religion, and sexual\\norientation.\\nThe Rules\\nThere are three basic rules you should follow:\\n\u2022 Follow Army regulations and the Uniform Code of\\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ).\\n156TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Take responsibility for your actions.\\n\u2022 Set the example, do what is right even when no one\\nis watching, and always keep your hands to\\nyourself.\\nWhile military discipline is the result of effective training, it\\naffects every aspect of military life. It is a characteristic\\nfound in individuals and units that demonstrate:\\n\u2022 Unit cohesion, bonding, and a spirit of teamwork.\\n\u2022 Smartness of appearance and action.\\n\u2022 Cleanliness and maintenance of dress, equipment,\\nand quarters.\\n\u2022 Respect to seniors and mutual respect between\\nsenior and subordinate personnel.\\n\u2022 Prompt and willing execution of both the letter, and\\nthe spirit of the legal orders of their lawful\\ncommanders.\\n\u2022 Fairness, justice, and equity for all Soldiers,\\nregardless of age, race, ethnicity, religion, color,\\ngender, or national origin.\\nStandards of Conduct:\\n\u2022 Decisions and actions remain consistent with the\\nArmy Values, laws, and regulations.\\n\u2022 Strict obedience and prompt execution of the legal\\norders of their lawful seniors.\\n\u2022 Doing what is right even when no one is watching\\nand choosing the hard right over the easy wrong.\\n157TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Accepting responsibility for your actions.\\n9-1. Non-Punitive Corrective Action\\nNonpunitive corrective measures are the primary tools for\\nteaching proper standards of conduct and performance and\\ndo not constitute punishment, nor are they required as a first\\nstep toward nonjudicial punishment. Included among\\nnonpunitive measures are denial of pass or other privileges,\\ncounseling, administrative reduction in grade, administrative\\nreprimands and admonitions, extra training, bar to continued\\nservice, and military occupational specialty (MOS)\\nreclassification.\\nOne of the most effective nonpunitive corrective measures\\nis extra training or instruction. For example, if Soldiers\\nappear in an improper uniform, they are required to correct it\\nimmediately; if they do not maintain their government\\nhousing area properly, they must correct the deficiency in a\\ntimely manner. If Soldiers have training deficiencies, they\\nare required to take extra training or instruction in subjects\\nrelated to the shortcoming. If a Soldier demonstrates minor\\nacts of indiscipline, physical exercise may be an acceptable\\nform of corrective training.\\nCorrective measures may be taken after normal duty hours.\\nSuch measures assume the nature of training or instruction,\\nnot punishment. Corrective training should continue only\\nuntil the training deficiency is overcome. Authority to use it is\\npart of the inherent powers of command.\\nUniform Code of Military Justice\\nSoldiers are subject not only to the laws of the United States\\nand host countries, but also the Uniform Code of Military\\nJustice (UCMJ). The UCMJ is a federal law that applies to\\n158TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nall Soldiers in an active-duty status, 24 hours a day and 7\\ndays a week, anywhere the world. Violations of Army\\nregulations, state and federal laws, and the orders of\\nsuperiors may constitute criminal conduct punishable under\\nthe UCMJ.\\nThe UCMJ enumerates a wide range of criminal offenses\\n(\u201cArticles\u201d) ranging from traditional crimes such as assault,\\ntheft, driving while intoxicated, disorderly conduct, murder,\\nand sexual assault; to military specific crimes such as\\nviolating a regulation, disrespect/insubordination,\\nfraternization, failure to pay debts, sexual harassment, and\\nany conduct that is prejudicial to good order and discipline\\nand/or of a nature to bring discredit to the service. The\\nUCMJ also establishes the various types of courts and sets\\nforth the procedures to be followed in the administration of\\nmilitary justice. You can find the UCMJ in Appendix 2 of the\\nU.S. Manual for Court Martial or in Title 10, United States\\nCode (USC), Sections 801-940.\\nUCMJ Article 15 authorizes commanders to impose non-\\njudicial punishment (NJP) for minor offenses when non-\\npunitive administrative corrective measures are inadequate\\ndue to the nature of the minor offense or because of the\\nservicemember\u2019s service record. Proceedings under Article\\n15 are not adversarial criminal prosecutions. This means\\nthat the hearing is not like a courtroom hearing (i.e., a court-\\nmartial). Neither the Soldier nor their spokesperson (or\\nretained lawyer) may examine or cross-examine witnesses\\nunless allowed by the commander and the commander is\\nnot bound by the formal rules of evidence.\\nThe UCMJ also authorizes commanders to convene court\\nmartials. Courts-martial are adversarial proceedings. That\\n159TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nis, lawyers representing the government and the accused\\npresent facts and arguments most favorable to each side. In\\ndoing so, they follow the rules of procedure and evidence.\\nThe judge decides questions of law. The court-martial\\nmembers apply the law and decide questions of fact.\\nUCMJ: Non-judicial punishment\\nNon-judicial punishment (NJP) is generally used to address\\n\u201cminor\u201d offenses related to intentional disregard of or failure\\nto comply with standards of military conduct.\\nOne of the purposes of NJP is to educate, correct, and\\nreform. It promotes positive behavior changes in Soldiers\\nwithout the stigma of a court-martial conviction.\\nWhether an offense is minor is within the discretion of the\\ncommander and depends on several factors including the\\nnature of the offense and the circumstances surrounding its\\ncommission; the offender\u2019s age, rank, duty assignment,\\nmilitary record, and experience; and the maximum sentence\\nimposable for the offensive if tried by court martial. Common\\nIET offenses punishable under Article 15 include\\ninsubordination, disrespect, fraternization, failure to report at\\nthe appointed time, and simple assault.\\nThe imposing commander will ensure that the Soldier is\\nnotified of the commander\u2019s intention to dispose of the\\nmatter pursuant to the provisions of UCMJ, Article 15, the\\nmaximum punishment, and the right to examine evidence,\\nseek counsel, present witnesses/evidence, and the right to\\ndemand a court-martial instead.\\nThe UCMJ, Article 15 proceedings are not adversarial in\\nnature. Soldiers may request an open or closed hearing.\\nThe Soldier is allowed to personally present matters in\\n160TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ndefense, extenuation, or mitigation in the presence of the\\nimposing commander, except when appearance is\\nprevented by the unavailability of the commander or by\\nextraordinary circumstances.\\nPunishment may include extra duty, restriction, forfeitures of\\npay, reduction in rank, oral or written reprimand, and\\ncorrectional custody. Whether to impose punishment and\\nthe nature of the punishment are the sole decisions of the\\nimposing commander. Soldiers may choose to submit an\\nappeal of the Article 15 findings and punishment to the next\\nhigher commander.\\nUCMJ: Court-martial\\nCourts-martial, in general, are adversarial trial proceedings.\\nAt a court-martial, a trial counsel represents the\\ngovernment, and a defense counsel represents the\\naccused. The court-martial system consists of three types of\\ncourts-martial: a summary court-martial, a special court-\\nmartial, and a general court-martial. In determining the\\nappropriate type of court-martial, a convening authority\\nconsiders a variety of factors including the interests of good\\norder and discipline, and the severity of the charged\\noffense(s).\\nA summary court-martial (SCM) is a court composed of one\\nofficer who may or may not be a lawyer. The SCM handles\\nminor crimes of enlisted Soldiers only and has simple\\nprocedures. The maximum punishment, which depends\\nupon the rank of the accused, is limited to confinement for\\none month (for E4s and below), forfeiture of two-thirds pay\\nfor one month, and reduction in grade. An SCM may not try\\nan accused against their will. If the accused objects, the\\n161TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSCM authority may consider trial by a higher court-martial.\\nThe accused does not have the right to military counsel at\\nan SCM, although he or she will see a trial defense attorney\\nbefore the court-martial. An SCM is a non-criminal forum\\nwhich means that a finding of guilty does not constitute a\\ncriminal conviction.\\nA special court-martial (SPCM) can try all Soldiers and\\nconsists of a military judge, four panel members (unless the\\naccused chooses to be tried by a military judge alone), a\\ntrial counsel, and a defense counsel. The maximum\\nsentence is a bad conduct discharge (BCD), confinement for\\ntwelve months, forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for\\ntwelve months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. If\\na BCD is adjudged, the accused has a right to an automatic\\nappeal to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals. A Convening\\nAuthority may also send a Soldier to judge only SPCM that\\nis not authorized to adjudge a punitive discharge with a\\nmaximum punishment of confinement not to exceed six\\nmonths, and forfeitures of pay not to exceed six months.\\nA general court-martial (GCM) tries cases over all Soldiers\\nfor the most serious offenses. It consists of a military judge,\\ntwelve members in a capital/death case and eight members\\nin a non-capital case (unless the accused elects to be tried\\nby a military judge alone), a trial counsel, and a defense\\ncounsel. Unless waived by the accused, a formal\\npreliminary hearing (an \u201cArticle 32\u201d hearing) must occur\\nbefore a GCM may try the case. The GCM may adjudge the\\nmost severe sentences authorized by law, including the\\ndeath penalty.\\n162TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n9-2. Military Equal Opportunity (MEO) Policy\\nThe MEO program ensures an Army-wide, concentrated\\neffort to maximize human potential and to ensure fair\\ntreatment for all persons based solely on merit, fitness, and\\ncapability in support of readiness.\\nThe MEO philosophy is based on fairness, justice, and\\nequity.\\nThe Army\u2019s MEO program emphasizes fair and equal\\ntreatment for military personnel, and civilian employees\\nwithout regard to race, color, religion, gender, or national\\norigin. This policy applies on and off post, extends to\\nSoldiers, civilian employees, and includes working, living,\\nand recreational environments.\\nComplaint process\\nThe MEO complaint processing system addresses\\ngrievances that allege unlawful discrimination or unfair\\ntreatment based on race, color, sex (to include gender\\nidentity), national origin, religion, or sexual orientation and\\nharassment, which includes hazing, bullying, and other\\ndiscriminatory harassment.\\nAlways attempt to resolve problems at the lowest possible\\nlevel in an organization.\\nAll submitted complaints are investigated. Personnel found\\nin violation of the MEO Policy are subject to punishment\\nunder the UCMJ.\\nWithin reason, Soldiers and other individuals are\\nencouraged to attempt resolution of any complaints by\\ndirectly addressing the alleged offender, or by informing\\n163TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nother appropriate officials about the offensive behavior or\\nunfair treatment.\\nKnowingly submitting a false complaint (a complaint\\ncontaining information or allegations that a Soldier knows to\\nbe false) may be punishable under UCMJ.\\nSoldiers must submit only legitimate complaints and should\\nexercise caution against frivolous or reckless allegations.\\nTypes of MEO complaints\\nThe Army has three types of complaints within the MEO\\ncomplaint process: anonymous, informal, and formal.\\nAn anonymous complaint is one in which the complainant\\nremains unidentified. It may be handled as either an\\ninformal or a formal complaint based on the Commander\u2019s\\ndiscretion. Actions taken regarding anonymous complaints\\nwill depend upon the extent of information provided in the\\nanonymous complaint.\\nAn informal complaint is any complaint that a Soldier does\\nnot wish to file in writing via DA Form 7279 (Equal\\nOpportunity and Harassment Complaint).\\nInformal complaints may be resolved by the complainant\\ndirectly with the assistance of another unit member, the\\ncommander, or another person in the complainant\\'s chain of\\ncommand.\\nTypically, those issues that may be taken care of informally\\nand can be resolved through discussion, problem\\nidentification, and clarification of the issues. An informal\\ncomplaint is still tracked in the MEO database.\\n164TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nA formal complaint is one that a complainant files in writing\\nusing a DA Form 7279 and swears to the accuracy of the\\ninformation.\\nFormal complaints require specific actions, are subject to\\ntimelines, and require documentation of the actions taken.\\nAlternative measures:\\nAlthough handling MEO complaints through the chain of\\ncommand is strongly encouraged, this is not the only\\nchannel available to Soldiers. Should a Soldier feel\\nuncomfortable in filing a complaint with the chain of\\ncommand, or should the complaint be against a member of\\nthe chain of command, there are several alternative\\nagencies through which a complaint can be made.\\nThe following agencies are frequently used:\\n\u2022 MEO professional\\n\u2022 Chaplain\\n\u2022 Provost Marshal\\n\u2022 Staff Judge Advocate\\n\u2022 Housing Referral Office\\n\u2022 Inspector General\\n\u2022 MEO Hotline\\nInspector General (IG): Serves as the eyes, ears, voice,\\nand conscience of the commander. The IG performs four\\nbasic functions: teaching and training; inspections;\\nassistance, and investigations. Providing the commander\\nimpartial fact findings to improve the Army and support the\\nChain of Command.\\n165TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nRight to appeal: If a complainant perceives an investigation\\nfailed to reveal all relevant facts, or if actions taken on their\\nbehalf are perceived as insufficient, they have the right to\\nappeal to the next higher commander.\\nThe complainant may not appeal the action taken against\\nthe perpetrator, if any is taken.\\n9-3. Policy on relationships between Soldiers:\\nArmy policy imposes many restrictions on senior-\\nsubordinate relationships. These restrictions are necessary\\nto maintain good order and discipline and to protect the\\nintegrity of the chain of command and the welfare of\\nSoldiers. See AR 600-20 and TRADOC Regulation 350-6,\\nfor more detailed policy on prohibited relationships and\\nactivities.\\nIn general, Soldiers of different grades in the Army must be\\ncognizant that their interactions do not create an actual or\\nclearly predictable perception of undue familiarity between\\nan officer and an enlisted Soldier, or between an NCO and a\\njunior enlisted Soldier. Army regulations prohibit any\\nrelationship between officers and enlisted Soldiers and\\nNCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers which results in the\\nfollowing effects:\\n\u2022 Compromise, or appear to compromise, the integrity\\nof supervisory authority or the chain of command.\\n\u2022 Cause actual or perceived partiality or unfairness.\\n\u2022 Involve, or appear to involve, the improper use of\\nrank or position for personal gain.\\n\u2022 Are, or are perceived to be, exploitative in nature.\\n166TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Cause an actual or clearly predictable adverse\\nimpact on discipline, authority, morale, or the\\ncommand\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission.\\nCertain types of relationships between officers and enlisted\\nSoldiers or between NCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers are\\nautomatically prohibited.

The Code of Conduct\\nThe Code of Conduct is our guide for how all Soldiers,\\nSailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard must conduct\\nthemselves if captured by the enemy. The Code of\\nConduct, in six brief articles addresses the intense\\nsituations and decisions that to some degree, all military\\nservices members could encounter. It contains the critical\\ninformation for U.S. prisoners of war to survive honorably\\nwhile faithfully resisting the enemy\u2019s efforts of exploitation.\\na. I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard\\nmy country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life\\nin their defense.\\n186TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nb.

I will accept neither parole nor special favors\\nfrom the enemy.\\nd. If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my\\nfellow prisoners. I will give no information or take part in any\\naction which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am\\nsenior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful\\norders of those appointed over me and will back them up in\\nevery way.\\ne. When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war,\\nI am required to give name, rank, service number, and date\\nof birth. I will evade answering further questions to the\\nutmost of my ability.

It denies the adversary\\nCRITICAL and SENSITIVE information about you, your\\norganization, and missions that if observed by your\\nadversary, can be used against us. You might ask: \u201cIf it\u2019s\\ncritical, wouldn\u2019t it be classified or something?\u201d OPSEC\\n187TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nprotects sensitive and/or critical information from adversary\\nobservation and collection in ways that traditional security\\nprograms cannot. While these programs, such as\\nInformation Assurance (IA), protect classified information,\\nthey cannot prevent all indicators of critical information,\\nespecially unclassified indicators, from being revealed. In\\nconcise terms, the OPSEC process identifies the critical\\ninformation of military plans, operations, and supporting\\nactivities, and the indicators that can reveal it, and develops\\nmeasures to eliminate, reduce, or conceal those indicators.\\nSo, what is my critical information you may ask? First, check\\nwith your leadership, to learn what information your\\ncommander has deemed critical. It will be in your\\ncommander\u2019s Critical Information List, or CIL. It contains\\ninformation items that are vital to the unit\u2019s mission that if an\\nadversary obtains it, correctly analyzes it, and acts upon it;\\ncould prevent or seriously degrade our mission success.\\nWhat else is critical? A simple acronym to use is CALI\\n(Capabilities, Activities, Limitations, and Intentions). It also\\nincludes items marked as Controlled Unclassified\\nInformation (CUI), Personally Identifiable Information, and\\nsensitive medical information. It may also include credit card\\nnumbers, security codes, passwords, home security,\\nfinancial history, and vacation plans. Always ask yourself,\\n\u201cWhat would an adversary or bad guy do with the\\ninformation?\u201d\\nWho are the adversaries?\\nInsiders. Those with misguided or divided loyalties,\\ncareless or disgruntled employees.\\n188TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nForeign Intelligence services (spies), or allied nations\\nthat collect to gain advantages over the US.\\nTerrorists, criminals, hackers, scam artists, identity\\nthieves, and the list goes on.\\nHow do they get my information?\\nSocial Engineering. Phone calls, emails (phishing),\\nrequests for information about you or your organization.\\nIs that really your bank or another unit asking for your\\ninformation?\\nSurveillance. What is in your trash/recycle bins, public\\nweb pages (.mil and unit social media sites), in your\\nwork area, or in your unencrypted emails? What\\ndiscussions are you having in public?\\nPhishing. Socially engineered email might contain\\ninfected attachments and/or hyperlinks that lead to web\\nsites hosting malware.\\nPersonal Mobile Devices. Hackers are rapidly\\ndeveloping malicious applications and programs for new\\ntechnologies. Very little security is built-in or readily\\navailable on these devices.\\nSocial Media. What are you, your family, and fellow\\nemployees posting, texting, or placing on social media?\\nCan it be used to social engineer or extort you? Can\\nterrorists or criminals target you?

Soldier for Life Program\\nThe U.S. Army established the Soldier for Life initiative in\\n1997 and increased its focus in July 2012. The intent was to\\ninspire Soldiers to identify as Soldiers for Life, always\\nremain proud of their service to the Nation, and conduct\\nthemselves as honorable men and women throughout their\\nlives not only as Soldiers but as Civilians. When Soldiers\\nreturn to society as private citizens, they remain moral-\\nethical exemplars for their Families and communities. Every\\nveteran of honorable service and Army retiree is a Soldier\\nfor Life and continues to contribute to the well-being of the\\nUnited States of America. In 2012, the Army Transition\\nAssistance Program was renamed the Soldier for Life\\nProgram and redesigned to enhance employment\\npreparation and opportunities for Soldiers leaving the Army\\nafter honorable service. Along with the Army Career and\\nAlumni Program (ACAP), the enhanced Soldier for Life\\nprogram was established to maintain trust with our Army\\nFamily during and after service. This program is designed to\\nenable Soldiers, Retired Soldiers, Veterans, and Families to\\nleave military service \u201cCareer Ready\u201d, and connect to an\\nestablished network to find employment, education, and\\nhealth resources. It focuses on the current serving\\npopulation to instill the Soldier for Life mindset of service.\\nThe Soldier for Life - Transition Assistance Program\\npromotes lifelong learning, individual development, and\\ntransition-related requirements throughout a Soldier\u2019s\\nmilitary Career. This program combines employment and\\neducation workshops and seminars tailored to prepare and\\nconnect transitioning Soldiers to meaningful civilian\\nemployment and education opportunities.\\n198TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSoldier for Life Centers are located on installations, posts,\\ncamps, and stations where Soldiers and Families can find\\nresources to assist them in making educated decisions and\\nsound plans during all phases of their military lives: in-\\nservice, and post transition.\\nThe Soldier\u2019s for Life goal is to \u201cStart Strong, Serve Strong,\\nand Continue Strong.\u201d\\nOnce a Soldier, Always a Soldier...a Soldier for Life!\\n199TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThis page left intentionally blank.\\n200TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nAppendix A - References\\nUnless otherwise indicated, TRADOC publications and\\nforms are available on the TRADOC Administrative\\nPublications website, https://adminpubs.tradoc.army.mil/.\\nDA publications and forms are available on the Army\\nPublishing Directorate website, https://armypubs.army.mil/.\\nDOD issuances and forms are available on the Executive\\nServices Division website, https://www.esd.whs.mil/DD/.\\nSection I\\nRequired Publications\\nThis section contains no entries.\\nSection II\\nRelated Publications\\nALARACT 068/2022\\nFiscal Year 2023 Approved Clothing Bag List, Initial Clothing\\nAllowance, Clothing Replacement Allowance, and Cash\\nAllowance\\nArmy Regulation 40-501\\nStandards of Medical Fitness\\nArmy Regulation 600-4\\nRemission or Cancellation of Indebtedness\\nArmy Regulation 600-8-22\\nMilitary Awards\\n201TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nArmy Regulation 600-20\\nArmy Command Policy\\nArmy Regulation 600-25\\nSalutes, Honors, and Visits of Courtesy\\nArmy Regulation 670-1\\nWear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia\\nArmy Techniques Publication 7-22.01\\nHolistic Health and Fitness Testing\\nArmy Techniques Publication 7-22.02\\nHolistic Health and Fitness Drills and Exercises\\nDA Pamphlet 670-1\\nGuide to the Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and\\nInsignia\\nField Manual 7-22\\nHolistic Health and Fitness\\nSTP-21-1-SMCT\\nSoldier\u2019s Manual of Common Tasks Warrior Skills Level 1\\nTraining Circular 3-21.5\\nDrill and Ceremonies\\nUCMJ (Appendix 2 of the Manual for Courts martial)\\n(Available on the Joint Service Component website,\\n202TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nhttps://jsc.defense.gov/Military-Law/Current-Publications-\\nand-Updates/)\\nWarfighter Nutrition Guide, May 2022.

Managing personal finances\\nIt is your duty as a Soldier to fulfill all your financial\\nobligations and provide for your Family members. There are\\n209TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nseveral key components to achieve this task. Here are 5\\nways to get started:\\n\u2022 Set financial goals. Whether it\u2019s to get out of debt or\\nbuild wealth, start with a clearly defined goal.\\n\u2022 Plan for your paycheck with a budget to meet all\\nyour financial obligations.\\n\u2022 Protect against financial emergencies with adequate\\ninsurance, a proper estate plan, and emergency\\nsavings.\\n\u2022 Be responsible with Debt and Credit \u2026especially\\nwhen purchasing a vehicle.\\n\u2022 Save for retirement by contributing at least 5% of\\nyour pay to your TSP.\\nIf you need assistance, visit your installation\u2019s Soldier\\nsupport center for money management services.\\nSetting Financial Goals:\\nPromotions, bonuses, incentive pay, and other pay\\nincreases are likely to happen throughout your Army career.\\nTo make the most of these financial opportunities, it\u2019s a\\ngood idea to write out clearly defined financial goals.\\nExamples of these goals might be to get out of debt,\\nestablish an emergency fund, invest towards retirement, or\\nsave for a major purchase. Financial goals provide you\\nguidance on how to best utilize your money and make smart\\nfinancial decisions.\\nSoldiers can log into the online pay system, MyPay, at\\nhttps://mypay.dfas.mil/ to review and print their leave and\\nearnings statement, thrift savings plan investments, savings\\n210TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ndeposit program Statement, allotments, savings bond\\npurchases, and direct deposit amounts. Ensure you visit the\\nofficial military website only.\\nSure-Pay program: The Army requires all Soldiers to enroll\\nin the Sure-Pay program. This means that your paycheck is\\ndeposited directly to a checking or savings account. If you\\nclose or change this account, you must ensure that you go\\nto MyPay and update the account information.\\nThe Army will pay you twice per month on the 1st and the\\n15th.\\nYou must carefully review your monthly leave and earning\\nstatement to ensure that your pay is being deposited\\nproperly and you are receiving all the benefits (Base Pay,\\nBasic Allowance for Housing (BAH), etc.) that you are\\nentitled.\\nBank deposit account: There are some key items to\\nconsider when choosing your financial institution.\\nFirst, inquire if there is a monthly service charge for\\nmaintaining a checking account. Numerous institutions offer\\nfree checking if you set up Sure-Pay (direct deposit).\\nThe Army requires frequent moves so find an institution that\\ncan accommodate your mobile lifestyle.\\nNext, create a plan for every dollar for every paycheck. Build\\na budget and track all cash inflows and outflows. Remember\\nto allocate some for savings and some for investing.\\nFinally, it\u2019s recommended to establish a separate savings\\naccount for emergencies. For example, start with a small\\n211TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ngoal, like a $1,000 balance, then save towards 3-6 months\\nof living expenses.\\nService Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA): The SCRA offers\\nmany benefits and protections to Soldiers and their\\nFamilies. It allows a service member to postpone or\\nsuspend certain civil actions while mobilized or deployed for\\nactive duty, including evictions, mortgage foreclosures,\\nbankruptcies, and other civil lawsuits. It covers all military\\nservice members from the date they enter active duty\\nthrough 30 to 90 days after active-duty discharge. The\\nSCRA also offers protection against high interest rate debt\\nsecured prior to entry into Active Duty; capping interest\\nrates on qualifying debt at 6%. Ensure you call all debtors\\n(credit cards, car loans, personal loans, etc.) as soon as\\npossible and notify them of your service, and that the SCRA\\nshould apply to your debt.\\nFailure to comply can result in legal action.\\nMilitary Lending Act: The Military Lending Act limits the\\nannual percentage rate for credit to no more than 36 percent\\nand includes associated costs of the loan, like fees and the\\nsale of credit products sold with the loan. This rate is known\\nas the military annual percentage rate, or MAPR.\\nAdditionally, the Military Lending Act prohibits mandatory\\narbitration, difficult contract provisions, using an allotment to\\nsecure the loan, waiving Servicemembers Civil Relief Act\\nrights, charging a penalty for early payments, using a post-\\ndated check to secure a loan, refinancing certain loans and\\nthe use of bank accounts and car titles to secure certain\\nother loans. Current protections cover payday, vehicle title\\nand tax refund anticipation loans. Purchases made through\\n212TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nrent-to-own and overdrafts on checking accounts are not\\ncovered.\\nLastly, while a local bank may be your best option, you may\\nopt to change accounts when you make a permanent\\nchange of station move.\\nCheck writing: You must pay close attention to each\\ntransaction to ensure you always know your checking\\naccount balance; this ensures you have sufficient funds in\\nthe account and do not write a fraudulent check.\\nManaging debt and maintaining good credit are important to\\nyour Army career. Establish a good credit reputation by\\npaying back debts on time, every time, and avoid carrying\\ndebt whenever possible.\\nBe thoughtful when making a major purchase, especially\\nwhen buying a vehicle. Carefully weigh the impact of a\\npurchase to your current and future situation.\\nThere are several consequences for writing a bad check,\\nservice charges, negative credit ratings, and additional\\npunishments if the check was used on post.\\nRetirement - Thrift Savings Plan (TSP): Although retirement\\nmay seem a long way off, the sooner you start saving the\\nbetter off you will be.\\nA delay of only 5 years in starting contributions could mean\\nseveral hundred thousand dollars later!\\nThe Army\u2019s retirement contribution system is the Thrift\\nSavings Plan (TSP). TSP contributions can be started online\\nat MyPay, then managed at https://www.tsp.gov/. In most\\ncases for new Soldiers the ROTH option (paying taxes\\n213TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nupfront but no taxes on interest when the money is\\nwithdrawn) is better, but it is important to research all\\noptions and talk to the financial planner at your Soldier\\nSupport Center.\\nMilitary One Source:\\nMilitary OneSource,\\nhttp://www.militaryonesource.mil/financial-and-legal and\\nmany other resources are available online to help you\\ndetermine how much to save, and how much money will be\\nneeded in retirement.\\nThe DOD Blended Retirement System (BRS) information\\nThe new retirement system is known as the \"Blended\\nRetirement System\" or BRS. The \u201cblending\u201d in BRS comes\\nfrom the blending of two major sources of retirement\\nincome: the existing annuity provision for those who retire\\nafter 20 or more years of service, PLUS the Thrift Savings\\nPlan (TSP). The TSP is a government-run 401(k) retirement\\naccount that allows members to invest their own money in\\neither stocks or government securities and get a contribution\\nto that account from their employer. Detailed information\\nand tools on the BRS are published on the DOD Military\\nCompensation website,\\nhttps://militarypay.defense.gov/BlendedRetirement/.\\nBRS uses the annuity formula currently in place: for those\\nstaying in the service 20 or more years, the average of the\\nservice member\\'s highest 36 months of basic pay would be\\nmultiplied by 2% times the number of years of service\\nThe best part of having a TSP contribution really applies to\\nthose who don\\'t stay in the military long enough to get a\\n214TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nretirement check. The government says that 83% of people\\nwho join the military don\\'t stay long enough to retire, so\\nwhen they leave after 5 or 10 years of military service they\\nbasically get nothing towards their future retirement. This\\nplan changes this situation. By contributing to the TSP,\\nmilitary members can leave the service at any time and\\nhave an existing retirement fund they can take with them\\nanywhere. Even if you decide to leave the military before\\ncompleting 20 years you keep the money in the TSP fund.\\nThe new system is made up of 3 specific components:\\n1. Defined Benefit:\\nRetired pay will be 2% times the number of years of\\nservice. If you retire at 20 years of service, you get 40%\\nof your final base pay. If you retire at 30 years of\\nservice, you get 60% of your \u2018high-three\u2019 base pay.\\nYou can either get your full retirement when eligible or\\nopt to get a lump-sum benefit at retirement. If you take\\nthe lump-sum you will get a reduced monthly retirement\\ncheck until age 67.\\n2. Defined Contribution:\\nThe military will contribute 1% of your base pay to\\nyour TSP.\\nYou will be automatically enrolled with a 3% base pay\\ncontribution to your TSP. (You can change this at any\\ntime.)\\nThe military will match up to 5% of your\\ncontribution after 2 years of service.\\n215TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nYou can always stop contributing to the TSP, get a loan\\nof your TSP balance, or withdraw your money from the\\nTSP account.\\n3. Continuation Pay: After you reach 12 years of active\\nservice and commit to 4 additional years of active\\nservice, you are eligible for a cash incentive of 2.5 to 13\\ntimes your regular monthly basic pay. This changes to\\n0.5 to 6 times your monthly basic pay if you are in the\\nreserves.\\nThe Department of Defense has several resources that\\nexplain the BRS on their Military Compensation website, to\\ninclude a BRS calculator. Members will receive BRS training\\nat their units.\\n216TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure B-2. Retirement system\\n217TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nB-3. Tri-Service Health Care (TRICARE)\\nThe Army is dedicated to taking care of its most important\\nassets: Soldiers, and military Family members.\\nTRICARE is the Department of Defense\\'s worldwide health\\ncare program available to eligible beneficiaries from the\\nuniformed services.\\nTRICARE is free to Soldiers but may involve some out- of-\\npocket expenses for Family members. The cost varies\\ndepending on the Soldier\\'s rank and the specific TRICARE\\nprogram option in which the Family member is enrolled.\\nThrough the TRICARE program, Family members can also\\ngo to civilian health care providers if they desire. But before\\ngoing to a civilian practitioner, Family members should talk\\nto the beneficiary counseling and assistance coordinator at\\nthe nearest military health care facility to see if there are any\\nout-of-pocket expenses. The beneficiary counseling and\\nassistance coordinator will confirm your registration in the\\nDefense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)\\nand can provide a list of doctors in your local area who will\\naccept TRICARE patients. Family members covered by\\nTRICARE can receive emergency care at any emergency\\nroom.

Servicemembers\u2019 Group Life Insurance (SGLI)\\nAs a United States Soldier, you may encounter hostile\\nsituations while stationed abroad and in combat. The well-\\nbeing of your Family is of the greatest concern to the Army.\\nOne of the many benefits afforded Soldiers is the\\nopportunity to purchase very low-cost life insurance. SGLI\\nprovides up to a maximum of $400,000. SGLI automatically\\ncovers you for this maximum amount unless you select, in\\nwriting a lesser amount, in increments of $50,000. You may\\nalso decline SGLI altogether, but this decision is so\\nimportant that you must also do that in writing. The payment\\nis deducted automatically from your pay each month.\\nSoldiers with Families almost always select coverage in the\\nmaximum amount.\\nSpouses and children are eligible for Family SGLI.\\nCoverage for a spouse is automatically $100,000 unless a\\nlesser amount, in steps of $10,000, is chosen.\\nVisit the Servicemember\u2019s Life Insurance page on the\\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs website at\\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/index.asp for\\nadditional information and assistance with enrollment.\\nB-5. Dental\\nThe level of dental care will vary from post to post, but it is\\navailable for all Soldiers. Family member care is generally\\nnot available at military dental facilities, but many locations\\nnow offer civilian dental practices on military installations.\\n219TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFamily members may receive dental insurance through the\\nTRICARE Dental Program (TDP). The TDP is dental\\ninsurance in which you pay a monthly fee in exchange for\\nFamily coverage. It is a voluntary, cost effective,\\ncomprehensive program offered worldwide by the\\nDepartment of Defense to Family members of all active-duty\\nbranches of the military, Selected Reserve, and Individual\\nReady Reserve members.\\nFamily members must be registered in DEERS to be eligible\\nfor the TRICARE Dental Program.\\nTo participate, the Soldier must have 12 months remaining\\non their service commitment at the time of enrollment and\\nsubmit an enrollment form with the first month\\'s premium or\\nenroll online using a charge card. The monthly premiums\\nwill typically be deducted from the Soldier\\'s pay, although\\nthere are other payment options.\\nDepending on the dental procedures performed, treatment\\nmay be completely covered by the insurance, or there may\\nbe co-payments.\\nThere is a maximum annual amount that TRICARE will pay\\nfor any one beneficiary. Once that yearly amount is reached\\nfor the individual, all costs above the maximum must be paid\\nby the Family.\\nWhen permitted, complete information and instructions on\\nhow to enroll and find a local dental provider are available\\non-line at the TRICARE Dental site,\\nhttp://www.tricare.mil/CoveredServices/Dental.aspx.\\n220TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nB-6.

Soldier for Life and credentialing\\nIf you serve faithfully and honorably, whether in the active or\\nreserve components, or serve for one enlistment or a long\\ncareer, you will be a Soldier for Life.\\n223TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe Army wants to be a partner in your lifelong success, to\\ninclude the successful transition to civilian life and civilian\\nemployment.\\nIt\u2019s never too early to start thinking about your long-term\\ngoals and taking steps, even small ones, to achieve them.\\nWhile in the Army, you will learn valuable skills. Strive to be\\nthe best in your specialty.\\nVeterans sometimes have trouble explaining their military\\nexperience in terms that are meaningful to civilian\\nemployers, in turn making it difficult to find a job.\\nOne of the best ways to strengthen your resume is by\\nearning a credential. A credential is a government-issued\\nlicense (usually from state governments) or a certificate\\nfrom a non-government credentialing agency, which shows\\nthat person is qualified to perform a particular job or activity.\\nCommercial truck driver\u2019s licenses and medical licenses are\\nexamples of government-issued credentials.\\nNon-government credentialing agencies that offer\\ncertifications include the National Institute for Automotive\\nService Excellence, the American Culinary Federation, and\\nthe American Welding Society.\\nTo learn about credentials related to your MOS, visit the\\nArmy Credentialing Opportunities On-line (COOL) website\\nat https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/index.html (or search your\\nweb browser for \u201cArmy COOL\u201d). You will learn more about\\ncredentialing in your military training and from the leaders in\\nyour unit of assignment.\\n224TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe Army Credentialing Program (ACP)\\nThe ACP enables Soldiers to capitalize on training and\\ndevelopment opportunities throughout their military careers\\nso that they can grow and develop as a Soldier. The three\\nvoluntary programs in the ACP portfolio are:\\n1. The United Services Military Apprenticeship Program\\n(USMAP)\\nWhile actively serving, you have the chance to enhance\\nyour job skills and accomplish civilian apprenticeship\\nrequirements through formal training. A dynamic blend\\nof hands-on experience and relevant technical\\ninstruction, resulting in credentials being recognized by\\nindustries far and wide. These credentials, coupled with\\nDepartment of Labor certification as a journey worker,\\nopen doors to remarkable career advancement.\\n2. Institutionally Delivered Credentialing (IDC)\\nIDCs aren\\'t just certifications, they\\'re pathways to\\nexpertise in your specific Military Occupational\\nSpecialties, Areas of Concentration, and courses.\\nGaining specialized skills that set you apart.\\nThese credentials can be accessed while attending\\nArmy Training Centers, NCO Academies, and\\nprofessional military education schools. Funding covers\\na comprehensive range, from course fees to licensing\\nexams and study materials to expert guidance. Contact\\nyour Schoolhouse point of contact before attending any\\nprofessional military education for IDC opportunities.\\n225TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n3. Credentialing Assistance Program (CA)\\nThe Army CA Program is your invitation to propel your\\nfuture \u2013 both during your military service and beyond.\\nChoose courses and exams that resonate with your\\ncareer aspirations. Whether you\\'re looking to elevate\\nyour skills within your current MOS or aiming for a new\\noccupational horizon that is not aligned to your MOS,\\npost-military service.

When you attend an Army School, you might be\\nasked to volunteer to take a credentialing exam. The Army\\nmight give you study material, including web-based training.\\nThey might pay your fees and decide for you to take the\\nexam. We encourage you to take advantage of these\\nprograms, take them seriously, and study.\\nYou could earn a valuable credential that will someday\\nmake your job application stand out.\\nThe Army believes that studying for a\\ncredential in your field makes you a more\\nwell-rounded Soldier, and it is one sign that\\nyou are a true professional in your military\\nspecialty.\\nThere is so much variety among military specialties,\\ncredentials, and credentialing agencies.\\nSome military specialties (for example, Motor Transport\\nOperators, Wheeled Vehicle Mechanics, Food Service\\nSpecialists, and many others) closely match civilian jobs.\\nOther valuable military specialties, such as Infantrymen and\\nArmor Crew Members, do not match civilian jobs.\\nIf you are in a specialty that does not closely match a civilian\\njob and does not have a lot of credentialing opportunities,\\nthere are several things you can do.\\nSome of these are good ideas for all Soldiers:\\n227TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 In the words of the Chief of Staff of the Army, the\\nbest credential is often a college degree. When you\\nfinish your Initial Military Training, talk the Career\\nCounselor in your unit and to an Education\\nCounselor, they can advise you about continuing\\nyour education.\\n\u2022 Remember that you are still learning life skills that\\nwill be valuable to an employer. Army Veterans tend\\nto be reliable, hard-working, goal-oriented, \u201cteam\\nplayers\u201d and drug-free. As a future Non-\\nCommissioned Officer (sergeant), you will learn\\nleadership, effective communication, how to train\\nothers, and how to supervise a job site.\\n\u2022 Even if your \u201cmain job\u201d doesn\u2019t match a civilian job,\\ntake advantage of any opportunities that come your\\nway to learn new skills, for example, computer skills\\nand operating and maintaining different types of\\nequipment.\\n\u2022 Keep checking! The Army is developing new\\ncredentialing opportunities.\\nTips and Precautions: One of the reasons that some\\ncredentials are so valuable is that they are hard to get. If\\nyou sign up for a credentialing exam, study!\\n\u2022 If you did your best, don\u2019t be discouraged if you\\ndon\u2019t pass on the first try. Remember everything you\\nlearned by studying to take the exam and consider\\ntrying again.\\n\u2022 If you choose a credential to work on, be sure that\\nthe credential is the right one for you. Before you\\n228TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nspend your money or use up some of your military\\nbenefits, make sure that the credential is offered by\\na reputable agency and is known and valued by\\nemployers.\\n\u2022 Many credentials have re-certification requirements\\nor continuing education requirements.

The U.S. Army\u2019s\\nasymmetric advantage in this volatile and complex world is our leadership at echelon. No other Army in the world\\ncan match us; frankly speaking, we have the best people.\\nI firmly believe that leaders are made and not born, and thus require a significant investment of time and energy\\nto develop. FM 6-22 assists in this quest and applies to all leaders at echelon, from fire team to division.It provides\\nspecifics and examples of how to develop leaders, including oneself. This doctrine walks through a range of\\ndevelopmental activities that focus on feedback, practice, and study.\\nThis manual tells the reader how an Army leader looks and acts.

The title change reflects the manual\u2019s\\nemphasis on developing leaders at the direct and organizational levels. FM 6-22 emphasizes the active process of\\nteaching, training, coaching, mentoring, study, and learning required for developing Army leaders. Development\\ndoes not merely happen because of established institutional and administrative policies; developing leaders\\nrequires deliberate intent and genuine engagement by raters, senior raters, instructors, trainers, support personnel,\\nand the leaders themselves.\\nLeadership is fundamental to Army operations as an element of combat power; subsequently developing leaders\\nrequires an understanding of related doctrine. To comprehend FM 6-22, readers should be familiar with the\\nfundamentals of leadership, attributes, and competencies in ADP 6-22, Army Leadership and the Profession;\\nunderstand the nature and fundamentals of operations as described in ADP 3-0, Operations; and be able to\\nexercise command and control as described in ADP 6-0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army\\nForces. The leader attributes and competencies are common to all Army leaders. Each branch identifies the\\ntechnical and tactical knowledge, skills and abilities required of leaders to perform their duties at specific grades\\nand positions. As the operations process is the framework for exercising command and control,readers must also\\nunderstand the fundamentals of the operations process established in ADP 5-0, The Operations Process.\\nThe principal audience for FM 6-22 is all Army leaders, military and civilian. FM 6-22 serves as a primary aid to\\nleaders to develop individuals and cohesive teams from the division down with a focus on company to brigade\\nlevels. Trainers and educators throughout the Army use this manual.\\nCommanders, staffs, and subordinates must ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable U.S.,\\ninternational, and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels will ensure that their\\nSoldiers operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and applicable rules of engagement.

Developing leaders is a complex and complicated undertaking because it is primarily\\na human endeavor\u2014requiring constant involvement, assessment, and refinement. Today\u2019s Army demands trained\\nand ready units with agile, proficient leaders. Developing our leaders and ourselves is integral to our institutional\\nsuccess today and tomorrow. It is an important investment for the Army\u2019s future because it builds trust in\\nrelationships and units, prepares leaders for future uncertainty, and is critical to readiness and our Army\u2019s success.\\nLeader development programs must recognize, produce, and reward leaders who are inquisitive, creative,\\nadaptable, and able to exercise mission command. Leaders exhibit commitment to developing subordinates\\nthrough executing their professional responsibility to teach, counsel, coach, and mentor subordinates. Successful\\nprograms that develop leaders incorporate accountability, engagement, and commitment; create agile and\\ncompetent leaders; produce stronger teams and organizations; and increase expertise.\\nDeveloping leaders involves many practices to ensure people have opportunities to fulfill their goals and the Army\\nhas capable leaders in position and ready for the future. Practices include recruiting, accessions, training\\n(including coaching, teaching, mentoring, fostering and advocating self-development), education, assigning,\\npromoting, broadening, and retaining the best leaders, while challenging them over time with greater\\nresponsibility, authority, and accountability. Army leaders assume progressively broader responsibilities across\\ndirect, organizational, and strategic leadership levels.\\nFM 6-22 integrates doctrine, experience, and best practices by drawing upon applicable Army doctrine and\\nregulations; input of effective Army officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers, and Department of the\\nArmy (DA) Civilians; recent Army leadership studies; and research on effective practices from the private and\\npublic sectors. This manual is about how to develop leaders to become skilled leaders. The Army\u2019s broader family\\nof field manuals develops leaders\u2019 technical and tactical expertise. Branches identify the technical and tactical\\nknowledge and skills for specific grades and positions.\\nTalent management and leader development are linked but separate processes. The Army develops individuals to\\nbe effective leaders. Talent management is an administrative process that puts the right person in the right job.\\nArmy leaders develop themselves and others by:\\n(cid:122) Planning, prioritizing, and engaging in developmenteven when resources are limited.\\n(cid:122) Gaining self-awareness thru feedback gained from performance counseling and assessments.\\n(cid:122) Integrating development into day-to-day activities.\\n(cid:122) Taking advantage of opportunities to provide constructive feedback.\\n(cid:122) Strengthening leader attributes and competencies during developmental activities.\\nThis manual is not intended to be read in a single sitting, although it is laid out in a fashion where that is possible.\\nThe information in this manual is best read and absorbed one chapter at a time, with time for reflection and\\ndigestion in between readings. FM 6-22 contains five chapters that describe the Army\u2019s doctrine covering how to\\ndevelop leaders:\\nChapter 1 discusses the Army\u2019s tenets for developing leaders, leader development challenges, leadership\\nrequirements, building teams, and development transitions across organizational levels.\\nChapter 2 addresses the fundamentals for developing leaders in units by setting conditions, providing feedback,\\nand enhancing learning while creating opportunities.\\nChapter 3 provides information on the individual\u2019s self-development process starting with identification of\\nstrengths and developmental needs, setting goals, and creating individual development plans.\\nChapter 4 provides recommended learning and developmental activities for the attributes and competencies.\\nChapter 5 discusses creating unit programs to develop teams of leaders and assessing unit programs.\\nThe References section includes pertinent links to recommended websites and developmental readings.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 ixIntroduction\\nIntroductory Figure 1.

There is no more important task for the U.S. Army than developing its people to lead others to defeat\\nany enemy, anywhere. Developing leaders is inherently part of every garrison activity, training event, and\\nreal-world operation Army forces conduct around the world. Each leader\u2013subordinate interaction is a\\ndevelopment opportunity. They are inseparable from training, enforcing standards, providing feedback, and\\nsetting a personal example.\\n1-2. Effective leaders represent the U.S. Army\u2019s strategic advantage over its adversaries, and developing\\nleaders ensures the Army maintains that advantage. The Army develops adaptable leaders capable of\\naccomplishing missions in dynamic, unstable, and complex environments. A robust, holistic, and purposeful\\nleader development program at strategic, organizational, and direct levels is essential to readiness and future\\nsuccess. The Army develops leaders who are agile, adaptive, and innovative through a mix of education,\\ntraining, and experience. This encourages a leader who acts with boldness and initiative to execute missions\\naccording to doctrine and orders. The goal is to develop Army leaders who clearly provide purpose, direction,\\nmotivation, and vision to their teams and subordinates while executing missions to support their\\ncommander\u2019s intent.\\n1-3. Developing leaders is fundamental to our Army. Leader developmentis the deliberate, continuous, and\\nprogressive process\u2014founded in the Army Values\u2014that develops Soldiers and Army Civilians into\\ncompetent, committed professional leaders of character. Leaders develop through career-long synthesis of\\nthe training, education, and experiences acquired through opportunities in the institutional, operational, and\\nself-development domains. Developing leaders includes all cohorts and components, beginning at\\nrecruitment and continuing until the leader leaves service (AR 350-1). A key component of leader\\ndevelopment is remaining focused on the professionalism of our leaders and those they lead. By developing\\nand promoting a professional force, the Army develops trust on several levels: between Soldiers; between\\nSoldiers and leaders; between Soldiers and Department of the Army (DA) Civilians; between Soldier families\\nand the Army; between the Army and Government; and between the Army and the American people. This is\\nwhy the Army commits to providing quality education institutions and training along with challenging\\nexperiences and opportunities throughout a career to develop effective leaders and ready units.\\n1-4. Setting the proper development expectations of subordinates is critical, so they understand their\\ndevelopment is a continuous process encompassing almost everything they do regardless of context.\\nSignificant leader development occurs during professional education, unit leader development programs, and\\ncounseling sessions. However, Army research shows the most effective developmental experiences occur in\\nthe operational domain, during daily interactions with subordinates as they prepare for and execute missions.\\nThese interactions create enduring positive results and prepare subordinates for greater levels of\\nresponsibility when they integrate with daily operations and allow for shared understanding about standards,\\ndesired outcomes, and lessons learned.\\n1-5. Developing leaders and being developedby others requires mutual understanding between leaders and\\nsubordinates\u2014both about the work involved in developing others and work needed to become a good leader.\\nThe developmental experience can be challenging and requires openness and a willingness to take risks and\\nlearn from experiences (both successes and failures). Those who lead and develop other leaders must treat\\nexperiences as lessons learned sources.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-1Chapter 1\\nLeader Development and Training Overlap\\nUnit or organizational culture that emphasizes developing leaders through training\\npriorities, sets expectations by grade and duty position, and develops leaders to\\nachieve those expectations, is a proven tactic for developing tactically-and technically-\\nsound subordinate leaders. Giving subordinate leaders opportunities to observe others\\noperating a rifle or gunnery range to standard then coaching them as they do likewise,\\nis an example of how training and leader development overlap in a practical sense.\\nThose subordinates are prepared to execute similar missions in their next unit while\\ndeveloping their subordinates for greater responsibility.\\nTENETS OF DEVELOPING LEADERS\\n1-6. Tenets of developing leaders are the essential principles that make the Army successful at developing\\nits leaders. The tenets provide a backdrop for the Army\u2019s unit training principles (see ADP 7 0). The\\noverarching tenets are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Strong commitment by the Army, superiors, and individuals to developing leaders.\\n(cid:122) Clear purpose and intention for what, when, and how to develop leadership.\\n(cid:122) Supportive relationships and culture of learning.\\n(cid:122) Three mutually supportive domains (institutional, operational, and self-development) that enable\\neducation, training, and experiences.\\n(cid:122) Providing, accepting, and acting on candid assessment and feedback for self-awareness.\\n1-7. The Army prioritizes developing its people beyond a directed responsibility to develop subordinates.\\nAR 600-100 directs Army leaders to develop their subordinates. Leaders must commit to developing others\\nand themselves; Members want to serve in an organization that values camaraderie and teamwork while\\nimproving others\u2019 capabilities. accountability for implementation follows responsibility.\\n1-8. Development occurs through both formal systems and informal practices. Reception and integration,\\nnewcomer training, developmental tasks and assignments, individual and collective training, educational\\nevents, transition or succession planning, and broadening are all activities where development occurs and\\nshould be encouraged. Development in the three mutually supportive domains (institutional, operational, and\\nself-development) involves experiential learning that is consistent with the principle of train as you fight.\\nAny experience that shapes and improves performance enhances development. Emphasizing any\\ndevelopmental domain at another\u2019s expense hinders learning.\\n1-9. Feedback is necessary to guide and gauge development. Formal and informal feedback based on\\nobservation and assessment provide information to confirm or increase self-awareness about developmental\\nprogress. The Army established performance monitoring, evaluation reports, coaching, growth counseling\\nprocesses, and self-awareness assessments to engage leaders and individuals. Feedback that goes from leader\\nto led is essential for learning along with other feedback sources to develop leaders. Forming a mentoring or\\ncoaching relationship outside unit lines is a means to obtain informal feedback. Another is the feedback\\nleaders obtain though self-assessments, study to improve, and application of knowledge orskills.\\n1-10. Development depends on having clear purpose for why, what, when and how to develop. Good leader\\ndevelopment is purposeful and goal oriented. A clearly established purpose enables leaders to guide, assess,\\nand accomplish development. The principlesfor developing leaders describe goals for what leaders need to\\nbe developed to do: lead by example, develop subordinates, create a positive environment for learning,\\nexercise mission command, adaptive performance, critical and creative thinking, and know subordinates and\\ntheir families. The core leader competencies and attributes identified in ADP 6-22 provide additional detail\\non what leaders need to be, know, and do.\\n1-11. Developing leaders includes holding subordinates accountable for maintaining Army standards,\\ndemonstrating the leadership requirements model competencies and attributes, adhering to Army Values, and\\naccomplishing missions. Leaders must consider each situation and select the best approach to hold\\nsubordinates accountable. Sometimes, a private verbal correction is adequate, in others, where time or safety\\n1-2 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Developing Leaders\\nare paramount, a public correction commensurate with the seriousness of the situation is warranted. In others,\\nwritten counseling provides a reference for future professional development. Setting expectations in a unit\\nabout how and why leaders hold subordinates accountable is itself a means of developing leaders. It ensures\\nshared understanding on effective leader requirements and unit standards, ultimately growing better leaders\\nand maintaining positive command climates.\\nLEADERSHIP REQUIREMENTS\\n1-12. The Nation and the Army articulate their expectations of Army leaders through the Army leadership\\nrequirements model (see figure 1-1) that illustrates expectations of every leader, whether military or civilian,\\nofficer or enlisted, active or reserve. It covers the core leader requirements and expectations of all leadership\\nlevels. Attributes are the desired internal leader characteristics\u2014what the Army wants leaders to be and\\nknow. Competencies are skillsand behaviors the Army expects leaders to acquire, demonstrate, and continue\\nto enhance\u2014what the Army wants leaders to do.\\n1-13. A clear leadership requirements framework provides leaders the basis to assess their strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs and to determine goals for improvement. The Army\u2019s leadership requirements model\\nspecifically provides leaders with enduring attributes and competencies. The model provides a consistent\\nreference point throughout professional and personal development progression.Leaders must improve in all\\nthe leader competencies, become more knowledgeable about the way the military operates, and understand\\nhow to operate in complex geopolitical situations.\\nFigure 1-1. Leadership requirements model (ADP 6-22)\\n1-14. As Army leaders develop themselves and others, they must guard against counterproductive leadership\\nbehaviors. The leadership requirements model identifies what leaders need to develop; counterproductive\\nleadership identifies where leaders may need correction as they develop. As future operational environments\\nwill be increasingly complex, it is imperative to identify and counteract anything that prevents mission\\nsuccess. Counterproductive leadership is the demonstration of leader behaviors that violate one or more of\\nthe Army\\'s core leader competencies or Army Values, preventing a climate conducive to mission\\naccomplishment (ADP 6-22). Counterproductive leadership has long-term negative effects on individuals\\nand units, impeding mission accomplishment and negating combat advantages.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-3Chapter 1\\n1-15. Counterproductive leadership tends to fall into several categories: abusive, self-serving, erratic,\\nleadership incompetence, and corrupt (see ADP 6-22 for complete descriptions). All leaders are susceptible\\nto counterproductive leadership, especially during stress, high operating tempo, or other chaotic conditions.\\nLeft uncorrected, the negative effects can quickly cascade, lowering morale, commitment, cohesion,\\nperformance, readiness, and mission accomplishment.\\n1-16. Counterproductive leadership is complex and must be handled in an effective and constructive way\\nthat does not lead to further problems. Table 1-1 provides questions to identify, assess, and address\\ncounterproductive leadership. Training modules are available on the CAPL website.\\nTable 1-1. Questions to focus approach dealing with counterproductive leadership\\nIdentify What is the behavior? What category does it fit in?\\nAssess What conditions and factors influence the behavior(s)? Define the situation, actors, behaviors, and\\nbehavior impact. Is there a pattern to the behaviors?\\nAddress What strategies (intervening for others, directly addressing, or strengthening resilience) should be\\nemployed to address or cope with the behavior?\\nDEVELOPING COHESIVE AND EFFECTIVE TEAMS\\n1-17. The Army relies on effective teams to perform tasks, achieve objectives, and accomplish missions.\\nBuilding and maintaining teams that operate effectively is essential. To do this, Army leaders employ Army\\nteam building, a continuous process of enabling a group of people to reach their goals and improve\\ntheir effectiveness through leadership and various exercises, activities, and techniques. Figure 1-2\\noutlines the Army team building process.\\nFigure 1-2. Army team building process model\\n1-18. Three qualities characterize good teamwork: climate, identity, and cohesion. Climate refers to how\\nmembers think and feel about their organization, based on shared perceptions and attitudes. It depends on the\\npersonalities within a unit, which change as people come and go. Team identity develops through a shared\\nunderstanding of what the team exists to do and what the team values. Cohesion is the unity or togetherness\\nacross team members and forms from mutual trust, cooperation, and confidence. Teamwork increases when\\nteams operate in a positive, engaging, and emotionally safe environment. An engaging environment occurs\\nwhere team members desire to work together on missions; they feel a sense of self-worth and accomplishment\\n1-4 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Developing Leaders\\nof something more important than they are. A safe environment occurs when team members feel they can be\\nopen and not threatened by unwarranted criticism.\\n1-19. Teamwork fosters open communication, improves professional relations, contributes to unit\\nmotivation, and builds trust. Teamwork pulls together a diverse groups\u2019 knowledge and experience to\\naccomplish the mission. Knowing the elements of effective teams and developing teamwork assists leaders\\nto assemble the team, orient them, create an identity, cultivate trust, engage in solving problems, manage\\nprocesses, regulate team dynamics, and deliver results to other organizations and stakeholders. High\\nperforming teams enforce high standards and hold each other accountable for their actions including their\\nperformance or output level. Table 1-2 compares effective and ineffective teams\u2019 characteristics. See ATP\\n6-22.6 for specific techniques.\\nTable 1-2.

The Army develops officers, at all levels, to understand and practice the mission command principles\\nto lead and conduct military operations to support unified land operations. The Army expects officers to\\nintegrate developmental practices with collective and individual training to accomplish the Army\u2019s missions\\nand develop subordinatesfor future responsibilities. They routinely operate at direct-level interactions with\\nothers and work at the organizational and strategic levels to plan, prepare, execute, and assess policies,\\nsystems, and practices. Warrant officers serve at all echelonsas the primary specialized experts, integrators,\\nmanagers, and trainers who operate, maintain, administer, and supervise the Army\u2019s equipment, support\\nactivities, and technical systems and processes in accordance with their primary career field. They bring an\\nunequalled depth of knowledge, experience, leadership, and perspective to operations. Warrant officers, at\\nall echelons, understand and practice the mission command principles to execute unified land operations. See\\nDA PAM 600-3 for developmental opportunities throughout an officer\u2019s career.\\n1-21. NCOs are responsible for setting and maintaining high-quality standards and discipline while\\nconducting daily missions making decisions based on disciplined initiative derived from commanders\\' intent.\\nNCOs serve as standard-bearers and role models vital to training, educating, and developing subordinates.\\nThrough training, coaching, mentoring, counseling, and informal interaction, NCOs guide Soldier\\ndevelopment every day and play a role in developing junior officers. NCOs advise officers at all levels and\\nare an important source of knowledge, experience, and discipline for all enlisted matters. See DA PAM 600-\\n25 for professional development opportunities.\\n1-22. DA Civilians provide crucial continuity and leadership to complement Soldiers\u2019 roles. DA Civilian\\nleaders require a broad understanding of military, political, and business-related strategies, as well as\\nmanagerial, leadership, and decision-making skills. DA Civilians develop other DA Civilians and support\\nmilitary leader development as supervisors, mentors, and instructors. DA Civilians should understand and\\nexercise the mission command principles while providing mission-based capabilities to support Army\\nmissions. See Department of Defense (DOD) Instruction 1430.16 and AR 690-950 for specifics.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-5Chapter 1\\nLeader development by walking around\u2014the continual face-to-face engagement by leaders during\\ndaily duties\u2014is the most effective informal means of developing leaders at the platoon, company,\\nbattalion, and brigade level.\\nTRANSITIONS ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS\\n1-23. Continual learning and development are the cornerstone for creating and sustaining an agile Army.\\nThrough activities in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains, personnel obtain\\neducation, training, and experiences to grow and succeed at positions of greater responsibility. As Army\\nleaders progress in leadership responsibilities, it is necessary for them to develop new skills and abilities to\\nrefine how they will lead at the next level.\\n1-24. The timing of development is especially important because personnel join and move through a series\\nof alternating and progressive education, training, and operational experiences. The approach applies to DA\\nCivilians as well; however, federal service does not program advancement opportunities for most positions.\\nDA Civilians move across positions based on the governing regulations and laws relating to applying for and\\nfilling positions. Ideally, the best direct-level leaders are developed into organizational level leaders and\\nultimately into strategic and enterprise level leaders.\\n1-25. In addition to the leadership requirements model, leaders must grow in their ability to understand,\\nvisualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess under differing conditions changing at each leadership level. As\\nleaders progress, they experience greater challenges based on the situation\u2019s scope, the consequences and\\nrisks involved, and the time horizon. As scope increases, the number of people and outside parties involved\\nincreases. The consequences of decisions increase, as do the risks that leaders must address. The length of\\ntime that leaders\u2019 decisions apply tend to increase at higher levels as well as the time over which leaders can\\napply influence.\\n1-26. Career transitions can be difficult, regardless of performance and potential at prior levels. When\\nmoving into new roles with different demands, individuals may not perform at a previous high level.\\nIndividuals must have a developmental mindset to improve what is within their capability and be motivated\\nto do their best. Their leaders have a responsibility to develop the capability. The Army endorses a culture\\nwhere individuals continually strive to learn, broaden personal skills, and improve.\\n1-27. The required attributes and the expected competencies leaders perform do not change. However, some\\nattributes and skills become more important in certain positions based on leader level and responsibilities\\n(see transition descriptions). Proficiency levels regarding leader performance are specific to the individual\\nleader, not their age, rank, cohort, or assigned position. Leaders of all ability levels should take advantage of\\nopportunities to improve. The true nature of the Army leadership attributes and competencies is that there is\\nno ultimate quality level to reach. Regardless of their capability, leaders are always able to learn more\u2014\\nincreasing their adaptability, versatility, and effectiveness when influencing others and improving their\\norganizations.\\n1-28. For military leaders, six leadership levels span the full range of Army organizations. The changes\\nacross levels correspond to the growth of responsibility, increase in the number of personnel affected, and\\nthe stakes involved. Not all levels and transitions apply to all organizational cohorts, military fields, or\\nfunctions and some Army positions do not fit neatly into this transitions model. Similar transition points exist\\nfor DA Civilians, each requiring progressive responsibility levels. Personnel begin by managing themselves.\\nLeading and preparing self is constant through the entire process no matter where one enters and exits the\\nleadership continuum. Self-management and self-preparation are important steps in preparing for initial\\nleader responsibilities. Six transitions that may apply to leaders in Army organizations are\u2013\\n(cid:122) Leading at the direct level. Initial-entry Soldiers and DA Civilians transition from a focus on self\\nto providing direct leadership to others to accomplish missions. Junior leaders learn how to plan\\ndaily tasks and activities, understand organizational constructs, and interact with subordinates,\\npeers, and superiors.\\n(cid:122) Leading organizations. The second transition occurs with leaders at the organizational level. This\\nlevel begins at company, battery, troop, staff, and similar organization levels for DA Civilians.\\n1-6 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Developing Leaders\\nDirect level leadership still occurs at this level, but the leaders become leaders of leaders and rarely\\nperform individual tasks, unless they serve in undermanned organizations or an emergency.\\nCoaching subordinate, direct-line leaders and setting a positive example as a leader are two\\ncharacteristics that stand out at this level.\\n(cid:122) Leading functions. The third transition is from leading an organization (as a leader of direct-line\\nleaders) to leading functions. This level involves directing functions beyond a single individual\u2019s\\nexperience path. Key characteristics are operating with other leaders of leaders and adopting a\\nlonger-term perspective. Functional leaders typically include majors, mid-level warrant officers,\\nand mid-level NCOs.\\n(cid:122) Leading integration. A fourth transition occurs when leaders assume command and leadership\\nresponsibility for battalion and similar-sized generating force organizations. These leaders must\\nbecome more adept at establishing and communicating a vision and deciding on goals and mission\\noutcomes. They need to find time for reflection and analysis and value the importance of making\\ntrade-offs between future goals and current needs. Positive attitudes related to trust, accepting\\nadvice, and accepting feedback pays dividends at this level and into the future.\\n(cid:122) Leading large organizations. A fifth transition occurs at the brigade-equivalent and higher levels\\nof operational and institutional organizations. They often operate outside their experience paths\\nwhile leading others operating beyond theirs as well. Leaders will only be successful by valuing\\nothers\u2019 expertise and success. Humility is a desired characteristic of organizational and strategic\\nleaders who should recognize that others have specialized expertise indispensable to success. A\\nmodest view of one\\'s own importance underscores an essential element to foster cooperation\\nacross organizations. Even the humblest person needs to guard against an imperceptible ego\\ninflation when constantly exposed to high levels of attention and opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Leading the enterprise. A final step occurs in the transition to serving as an enterprise leader.\\nEnterprise leaders must be long-term, visionary thinkers who spend considerable time interacting\\nwith agencies beyond the military. This leader must be willing to relinquish control of enterprise\\nelements to strategic and junior-level leaders.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-7This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 2\\nFundamentals of Development\\n2-1.

Other sources provide guidance on techniques associated with the\\nformal activities, such as AR 623-3 on the evaluation process, AR 621-7 and DA PAM 600-3 on broadening\\nassignments, ATP 6-22.1 on the counseling process, and ATP 6-22.6 on team building.\\n2-2. Leadership requires establishing interpersonal relationships based on trust and setting the example for\\neveryone\u2013\u2013subordinates, peers, and superiors. In leader development surveys, leaders ranked leading a unit,\\npersonal examples, and mentoring as the three most effective ways to develop their leadership skills.\\nExperience is a powerful learning tool; however, learning from experience is not guaranteed. As the tenets\\nfor developing leaders convey, learning requires commitment and purpose. Learning occurs after reflecting\\non experiences. This chapter covers setting the conditions for development, gathering and providing\\nfeedback, reflection and study, and creating opportunities for continued experiential learning.\\n2-3. The following sections focus on the fundamentals of developing leaders (see figure 2-1):\\n(cid:122) Setting conditions for development.\\n(cid:122) Providing feedback on a leader\u2019s actions.\\n(cid:122) Enhancing learning through mentoring, training, reflection, and study.\\n(cid:122) Creating opportunities and evaluating effectiveness.\\nFigure 2-1.

Subtle actions on the leader\u2019s part build trust and communicate the role of trainer and developer.\\nExperienced leaders use several techniques to create a developmental culture:\\n(cid:122) A leader should be present to observe enough key activities without overwhelming subordinates.\\nAfter initial observations, give the observed leader time and space to exercise leadership without\\nbeing in the spotlight. This helps establish the leader\u2019s role as a supportive resource rather than an\\nevaluative note taker. It builds trust, self-confidence, and creativity in the follower.\\n(cid:122) As often as possible, leaders should employ an indirect approach. Start by providing observation\\ndescriptions along with positive and negative outcomes. Allow the subordinate to understand what\\nis going well and what needs improvement. The opposite of an indirect approach is to\\nmicromanage and be overly prescriptive, outlining specifics for completion.\\n(cid:122) Give each leader a fresh, objective start. Compare subordinates against objective standards. Avoid\\nsubjective comparisons to past leaders or units (including personal experiences). The bottom line\\nis to observe and assess each leader on individual merit. Avoid thinking of the observation process\\nas a means to grade leaders.\\nMistakes occur in all organizations and operational environments. Leaders foster a learning\\nenvironment by acknowledging that honest mistakes come with challenging missions. Tell leaders\\nabout a risky, challenging mission. Recount the mistakes made in trying to accomplish it. Wrap\\nup the discussion with the lessons learned from the experience.\\nLEARNING PRINCIPLES\\n2-8. Development is a change process. Applying learning principles throughout development accelerates\\nand improves learning. Table 2-2 presents principles to promote effective, efficient, and appealing learning.\\nTable 2-2. Learning principles\\nPrinciples How each principle works to encourage development\\nBeing task-or Learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. Real situations engage the learner\\nproblem-centered to thinkand act in ways that are relevant to future outcomes.\\nActivation Knowledge the learner already has serves as a foundation for new knowledge.\\nDemonstration New knowledge is demonstrated to the learner.\\nThe learner applies new knowledge. Repetition and practice across varying conditions\\nApplication enhances application\u2014interaction with role models and mentors, feedback and\\nreflection, and studying other leaders.\\nIntegration New knowledge is integrated into the learner\u2019s world.\\n2-9. These principles are compatible with and supportive of learning that occurs while completing duties,\\npractical exercises, or collective training. Opportunities that challenge the individual and encourage learning\\nenhance development. Learning best occurs when the interest area has real-world relevance, and the learner\\ncan synthesize new insights or create new knowledge.\\n2-10. Purposeful learning starts when learners are challenged to know more and do better. Purposeful\\nlearning occurs when practice at mastery of tasks and skills are integrated into leaders\u2019 day-to-day activities.\\nApplying the learning principles results in leaders who actively engage in learning, quickly retain and recall\\ninformation, and transfer learning to novel situations.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-3Chapter 2\\nIncorporating Developmental Opportunities\\nWhen assessing her company\u2019s performance from the previous week during the\\nbattalion training meeting, CPT Williams asserts that Alpha Company\u2019s squad\\ncohesion is not where it needs to be for the company to advance to platoon collective\\ntraining. Clearly frustrated, CPT Williams suggests to the battalion commander, LTC\\nCano, that last quarter\u2019s red cycle tasks and summer transitions prevented leaders\\nfrom developing their Soldiers, teams, and squads. Her first sergeant and fellow\\ncommand teams nod their heads in agreement.\\nLTC Cano: \u201cI understand your frustration, but we cannot allow high operating tempo\\nand Soldier turnover to interfere with our principal obligation as leaders: developing\\nour subordinates. Installation taskings, reception, and farewelling departing teammates\\nare all developmental opportunities and activities that should enhance cohesion.\u201d\\nCSM Baker: \u201cThat\u2019s true sir, but I\u2019m not sure our battalion unit training plan adequately\\nreflects the deliberate and continuous process that is fundamental to developing\\nleaders. The current plan implies leader development is just something we do in a\\nclassroom once per quarter.\u201d\\nLTC Cano: \u201cFair assessment sergeant major. MAJ Blank, you and I will review the\\nbattalion training plan this week. I want to ensure each event includes leader\\ndevelopment objectives linked to the Army\u2019s leadership requirements model.\u201d\\nGAINING KNOWLEDGE OF SUBORDINATES\\n2-11. For effective leader development, individual relationships with each subordinate are necessary.\\nLeaders who routinely interact with subordinates understand their subordinates\u2019 backgrounds and\\nexperiences better. This enables discovery of special skills and experiences to support specific missions.\\nGetting to know subordinates communicates a genuine interest in them as individuals, builds confidence, and\\ngenerates trust. Trust is key to having candid talks with leaders about their developmental needs.\\nTEAM TRUST ANDUNIT COHESION\\n2-12. Creating a positive climate that encourages learning contributes to all development aspects.\\nSubordinates have to be receptive, engaged, and ready to develop. Leaders should be aware of subordinate\u2019s\\nindividual needs when building rapport and offering feedback. Some individuals will need more; some will\\nneed less. Some individuals seek additional attention and feedback while some will want less.\\n2-13. The objective of engaging with subordinates is to listen to their responses and understand their\\nsituation. Build rapport by sharing something about yourself. Early in interactions withsubordinates, briefly\\nshare personal experiences\u2014including areas of specialized expertise and areas of less experience.\\n2-14. In certain circumstances, using social media to observe and share ideas may be beneficial. Accepting\\nan invitation to connect with a subordinate or allow a subordinate to follow your social media requires\\nforethought. Social media platforms allow subordinates to observe how leaders align their words and deeds\\nand allow leaders to observe and engage with subordinates about life events during and after service.\\n2-4 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nSharing Experiences\\nLearning from others\u2019 experiences can be invaluable.

Counseling and feedback provide clear, timely, and accurate information concerning individual\\nperformance compared to established standards. During professional growth counseling and feedback\\nsessions, leaders should help subordinates identify individual strengths and developmental needs to design\\nan individual development plan (IDP), a tool primarily used by the individual subordinate to document short-\\nand long-term goals for career and personal development. All individuals are responsible for developing and\\nmaintaining their IDP. Leaders gain better understanding of their subordinates by helping them refine their\\nIDP for an individualized approach to professional development. Likewise, individuals and leaders should\\nunderstand that preparing an IDP does not solve all development issues\u2014the form only documents and guides\\nthe necessary actions to reach the specified goals while employing strengths and addressing needs. Reserve\\nComponent IDPs should include career development goals that balance Army careers with civilian careers.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-5Chapter 2\\nIntegrating Individual Development Plans\\nCOL Jones and CSM Hart are conducting their daily closeout meeting after the brigade\\nmission analysis brief for an upcoming combined arms live fire exercise.\\nCOL Jones: \u201cSergeant major, I\u2019ve noticed a trend during our brigade train up that\\nsuggests our leaders at echelon are having trouble anticipating risks and opportunities\\nin our large-scale combat operation training scenarios.\u201d\\nCSM Hart: \u201cThat is interesting sir. Where are these trends coming from?\u201d\\nCOL Jones: \u201cI had our battalion commanders analyze their subordinates\u2019 IDPs to help\\nus identify our strengths and weaknesses. They briefed their analysis during the latest\\ntraining brief. Our leaders self-identified mental agility as an attribute they considered\\na developmental need. Also, you and I have observed that our leaders need more\\ntraining reps to teach them what future tasks and resources to anticipate in combat.\u201d\\nCSM Hart: \u201cWell sir, if we identify these needs early in exercise planning it will give us\\nsome options. We could conduct a formal professional development session for the\\nbrigade, but I doubt we have the space available in the unit training plan to adequately\\naddress these dynamic developmental needs. Another option is to be deliberate with\\nexercise planning to incorporate these specific developmental needs as part of your\\ntraining objectives.\u201d\\nCOL Jones: \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea sergeant major. Let\u2019s meet with MAJ Price tomorrow\\nto brainstorm some ways to induce critical thinking to our leaders during training.\u201d\\nCOL Jones and CSM Hart met with MAJ Price to adjust the exercise scenario and\\ntraining objectives to purposefully challenge, evaluate, and provide feedback on\\nleaders\u2019 ability to think critically and anticipate environmental changes. COL Jones\\nused his opening comments prior to the course of action brief to update the battalion\\ncommand teams on his intent to develop leaders.\\nSECTION II\u2013PROVIDING FEEDBACK\\n2-16. Leaders need to learn how to observe subordinates and provide developmental feedback. Using several\\nassessment and feedback methods provides a robust and more accurate picture of the individual and provides\\nbetter developmental opportunities.\\n2-17. A leader\u2019s ability to provide feedback to subordinates significantly contributes to their development.\\nIt enhances and accelerates learning from the day-to-day work experience\u2014the most valued and effective\\nenvironment for development. Feedback can reinforce (through recognition or praise) or change or eliminate\\n(such as correction, constructive criticism, or alternative approaches) behaviors.\\n2-18. Timely, accurate feedback translates into better leader performance, which in turn, has a positive effect\\non unit performance and mission success. Providing accurate feedback starts with planned observation and\\naccurate observation and assessment.\\nOBSERVATION PLANNING\\n2-19.

It usually takes several\\nobservations before a behavior pattern emerges. Take time to gather information from others\\nobserving the same leader, as different people focus on different aspects.\\nACCURATE AND DESCRIPTIVE OBSERVATIONS\\n2-20. Accurate, descriptive leadership observations are important to assess performance and provide\\nfeedback that produces focused learning. Assessing performance into developmental need, meets standard,\\nand strength categories informs what needs development or sustainment and provides motivation to develop.\\nThese behavior indicators provide general performance measures for varying proficiency levels for the leader\\nattributes and core leader competencies required of all Army leaders (see ADP 6-22). Understanding the\\nbehavior indicators and observation methods provides a strong base to provide others\u2019 feedback, specifically\\nwhen using formal tools such as DA Form 4856 (Developmental Counseling Form), DA Form 67-10-1A\\n(Officer Evaluation Report Support Form), or DA Form 2166-9-1A(NCO Evaluation Report Support Form).\\n2-21. Observing leadership occurs by watching how a leader interacts with and influences others. Written\\ndirectives, verbal communications, and leader actions all indicate how a leader performs. Raters learn about\\nsubordinates\u2019 leadership by observing reactions among peers, subordinates, and other superiors.\\n2-22. The following performance indicators are grouped according to the leadership requirements model by\\nleader attribute categories (character, presence, and intellect) and leader competency categories (lead,\\ndevelop, and achieve). The performance indicators provide three proficiency levels: a developmental need,\\nthe standard, and a strength. For developmental purposes, these three categories are sufficient and apply\\nacross cohorts. A developmental need is identified as a specific need for development when the observed\\nindividual does not demonstrate the leader attribute or competency. Strength indicators are associated with\\nsuccessfully performing leader attributes or competencies. Strengths include a consistent pattern of natural\\ntalents, knowledge gained through learning, and skills acquired through practice and experience.\\n2-23. Tables 2-3 through 2-8 (see pages 2-6\u20132-11). illustrate a focus on core leadership characteristics. Army\\nadoption of a core attribute and competency model means that no list comprehensively lists all performance\\nrequirements for any leader. Each rater, counselor, mentor, or trainer will need to address specific duty or\\nfunctional requirements. Theyshould be able to apply the ideas to specific performance objectives designated\\nfor individuals that exceed the core leadership requirements.\\n2-24. While comparing observations against the leader performance indicators, determine the observed\\nleader\u2019s proficiency level: first review the behavior that appears in the center column, which represents the\\nstandard for leader performance. The column on the left describes performance indicating a strength\\n(individual exceeds the standard), while the column to the right describes performance indicating a\\ndevelopmental need (individual does not meet the standard).\\n2-25. Understanding the competencies and attributes in the Army leadership requirements model is essential\\nto make careful and accurate observations of a subordinate\u2019s performance and evaluation of potential. Leader\\nattributes are inward characteristics that shape the motivations for actions and bearing, and how thinking\\naffects decisions and interactions with others. Attributes support a leader\u2019s development and effective\\nperformance. The core leader competencies apply across all leadership levels while subtle changes occur in\\npurpose and activity at each level and include how Army leaders lead people; develop themselves,\\nsubordinates, and organizations; and achieve the mission. They are what the Army expects of all leaders and\\nare the most outwardly visible leader performance signs.\\nCHARACTER\\n2-26. Character is a person\u2019s true nature comprised of their morals, virtues, values, conscious and sense of\\npurpose, which make up their core and are the mindset and moral foundation behind actions and decisions.\\nLeaders of character adhere to the Army Values, display empathy, the Warrior Ethos/Service Ethos, humility,\\nand practice good discipline.

Observing subordinates requires leaders to find a balance between being dispassionate in their\\nobservation and still being empathetic to their Soldiers. Subordinate leaders who know they are being\\nwatched may behave differently with their observing leaders around. Observation also requires emotional\\nperception. Knowing when a subordinate is overwhelmed, nervous, not receptive, or frustrated is key to\\nhelping them through the development process. Observations should be accurate, descriptive, tied to a key\\nevent and accurately depict a behavior pattern without observer bias.\\nACCURATE,DESCRIPTIVE OBSERVATIONS\\n2-34. Observing behaviors occurs by watching how a leader interacts with and influences others.\\nObservations focus on what was or was not done well and what to do differently. Written directives, verbal\\ncommunications, and actions all provide indications of how a leader influences others. Leaders learn about\\ntheir subordinate by observing the reactions of peers, subordinates, and superiors. The observer must also\\nconsider howto differentiate performance of a desired behavior, the ability and initiative shown to improve\\nor engage in a desired behavior, and the extent and duration of effects that the behavior has on individual or\\nunit performance.\\n2-35. Three key components ensure observations are accurate and descriptive:\\n(cid:122) Plan multiple observations around key events, but also observe routine operations.\\n(cid:122) Look for behavior patterns.\\n(cid:122) Record important observations immediately for use in performance and professional growth\\ncounseling and evaluations.\\n(cid:131) Use words that depict action.\\n(cid:131) Link to effects and outcomes.\\nPLAN OBSERVATIONS AROUND KEY EVENTS\\n2-36. Key training events offer opportunities to demonstrate a considerable number of leadership\\ncompetencies and attributes. Major training events require time to plan, prepare, execute, and assess.\\nTherefore, an observer can interact with their subordinate throughout the event to offer insights and enable\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-13Chapter 2\\ncorrections. Most training events are controlled environments with clear standards for execution, making it\\neasier for an observer to structure feedback and additional event iterations, if necessary.\\n2-37. Training events also allow a unique opportunity for observers to see how a learning leader reacts to\\nfriction, frustration, and, in certain circumstances, failure. An observer can help the observed Soldier\\nunderstand how successful and poor reactions to events affects unit and mission success. Additionally,\\ntraining events can stop and restart as needed to allow an observed Soldier to immediately correct mistakes\\nand address lessons from their observer. Knowing when to start, restart, or stop the event all together requires\\nan observer to be familiar with the level of mental or emotional fatigue a Soldier can manage before they are\\nno longer able to retain oradapt to new information.\\nLOOK FOR BEHAVIOR PATTERNS\\n2-38. With time and frequent observation, leaders gain confidence and start to see a consistent behavior\\npattern. It is a judgment call as to when to consider an observation as a behavior pattern. To observe for\\npatterns, note how often a leader exhibits the same behavior over time. The behavior frequency may indicate\\na pattern. If sufficient time has passed and the observer can predict the leader\u2019s actions, then a behavior\\npattern has emerged. Be alert to changes in performance and causes for strengths, inconsistencies, or\\ndevelopmental needs.\\nRECORD IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS\\n2-39. Important leadership observation details may be lost or be inaccurately recorded if not written down\\nsoon after they occur. A way to capture observations and assessment is to use a quick, accurate, and complete\\nmethod to take notes that supports an effective feedback session such as using a situation, observation,\\nassociate and assess, and reinforce and recommend (SOAR) framework. SOAR elements are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Situation\u2014Describe the assessment situation and conditions. This should include the time,\\nlocation, event, or other situation context.\\n(cid:122) Observation\u2014Describe the leadership behaviors that the leader exhibits.\\n(cid:122) Associate and Assess\u2014Identify and associate the competency or attribute that best describes the\\nleader actions.\\n(cid:122) Reinforce and Recommend\u2014Record how to reinforce the leader\u2019s behavior through praise or\\ncorrection.\\n2-40. Accurate and complete notes are useful when providing leaders with feedback. The SOAR format is\\none way that leaders can record observations; however, leaders might choose to use a different method that\\nfits their own style and needs.\\nUse words that depict action\\n2-41. A leader needs to describe what the subordinate is doing when they are leading. By writing down an\\nobservation using action words, the observer can tell a better story about all the other unseen circumstances\\nsurrounding behaviors, decisions, and actions. Writing an observation down as though writing a story\\nprovides a better picture for the observed Solider, who is often too wrapped up in the leading process (under\\nobservation) and may not see immediate feedback from others or actions.\\nLink to effects and outcomes\\n2-42. Leaders and Soldiers in subordinate echelons feel the positive or negative consequences of a leader\u2019s\\naction. Leadership affects task or mission accomplishment. Understanding cause and effect for a subordinate\\nleader\u2019s actions and effects on a mission or unit is a complex process. Aligning all facts for feedback can\\ndelay the feedback process and requires experience and empathy to balance the need for facts and feedback.\\nLeaders can undermine trust by providing an incorrect cause and effect to a subordinate, which undermines\\ntheir willingness to continue learning tolead effectively. An observer-leader is obligated to seek the relevant\\ncontributing factors to events before providing feedback. While it is not always possible to see everything,\\ncoordination with other staff and trusted observers will fill in gaps necessary to provide richer feedback.\\n2-14 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nFEEDBACK DELIVERY\\n2-43. When experienced leaders reflect on their own development, they place high importance on day-to-\\nday, two-way communication with their senior leaders because they do the same with their subordinates.\\nFeedback is less effective if a leader waits until a formal sit-down counseling session to provide feedback.\\nLeaders should provide feedback as soon as possible after observing a particular leader behavior to encourage\\npositive outcomes.\\n2-44. Day-to-day informal feedback makes sitting down with subordinates for developmental counseling\\nmuch easier. This informal feedback develops a shared understanding of the subordinate\u2019s strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs. Still, many leaders find it difficult to sit down with a subordinate to engage in\\ndevelopmental counseling. ATP 6-22.1 provides extensive guidelines on the counseling process.\\nProviding feedback on every observed act, response, or behavior overwhelms a subordinate.\\nProvide feedback based on established competencies and attributes. Focus feedback on a few key\\nbehaviors that, if changed, contributes the most to improved leader and unit performance. Having\\na focus for improvement motivates the subordinate to take action to change.\\nAsk the observed leader for a self-assessment before providing personal views. Do this by first\\nrecounting back to the leader the situation and observation (the first two SOAR sections). Then\\nask the leader to provide an assessment and recommendation. This reinforces three important\\nleader development principles: leader self-assessment and self-awareness, individual leader\\nresponsibility for development, and leader ownership of the recommendation.\\nPREPARATION AND TIMING OFFEEDBACK DURING TRAINING\\n2-45. Before training starts, leaders should explain the feedback tool to the unit and its leaders and general\\nfeedback process expectations. Leaders should emphasize the feedback\u2019s developmental nature. In preparing\\nto give feedback, the observer sets several goals to ensure a successful outcome. An observer finds the best\\nbalance between gathering relevant facts that will provide context to the lesson but without overwhelming\\nthe learner with information. Organizing feedback using a pre-arranged feedback tool helps an observer keep\\nto the relevant material and gives the receiver an idea of what to expect. By discussing feedback formats and\\nexpectations, a leader can ask their observer to focus observations on specific areas where they may feel\\nuncertain or want to improve. Sharing control and expectations for a feedback event between the observer\\nand leader increases the potential to listen and learn and decreases defensive or confrontational behavior.\\n2-46. The timing to discuss leadership observations can be critical and a deciding factor between whether\\nperceiving a situation as evaluative or developmental. Ultimately, determining the appropriate time to deliver\\nan observation is at the leader\u2019s discretion. The observer should be prepared, calm, motivated to share\\nobservations, and be familiar with the conditions that make a leader comfortable with receiving and\\nunderstanding feedback. If an observer is rushed and the leader is frustrated or angry, it may be advisable to\\ndelay feedback delivery. Use personal judgment to consider whether delivery should occur during action, at\\na break in action, at day\u2019s end, or at event completion based on conditions.\\n2-47. Sometimes, leaders deliver observations as they occur or \u201cduring the action\u201d feedback. This is\\nespecially true when pointing out to the leader those actions must occur in the moment to allow observation.\\nHowever, do not disrupt the training exercise.\\n2-48. Find the right break in the action to deliver observations. This could be during a lull after a major event\\nhas occurred (a major success or a failure). Consider waiting until day\u2019s end, especially if observations are\\nlengthy and require discussion. To enable better collective learning, wait until after conducting the unit or\\nteam after action review (AAR). Then, deliver observations to the subordinate privately. This aligns\\nobservation delivery of the subordinate\u2019s strengths and areas for improvement with those of the unit or team\\nas identified in the AAR, assuming they are compatible.\\n2-49. If observation delivery is best done at the event completion, consider letting the subordinate set the\\ntime for the discussion. At a minimum, provide a \u201cheads up\u201d about a situation or circumstance to be\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-15Chapter 2\\ndiscussed. This allows the observed leader an opportunity to reflect and mentally prepare to listen and receive.\\nThis also allows an observer a chance to gather their thoughts, address their emotions, and ensure they have\\na complete understanding of the event\u2019s results for the leader and unit. This approach reduces the likelihood\\nthe subordinate will be preoccupied, nervous, or defensive.\\nOBSERVATION DELIVERY\\n2-50. It is important to plan how to deliver observations to a subordinate. The following delivery methods,\\nwhen done correctly, provide a leader with an understanding of the effect behaviors have on consequences,\\nall based on careful and planned observations. The two-way communication techniques used to deliver an\\nobservation should motivate subordinates to start acting in ways that improve leader and unit performance.\\n2-51. These steps represent an indirect approach to providing leadership observations. Once leaders are ready\\nto discuss observations and reinforce and recommend actions, the following steps provide an effective\\nframework for delivering observations and flow in a logical sequence\u2014\\n(cid:122) Confirm the observed event being discussed.\\n(cid:122) Ask the leader for a self-assessment.\\n(cid:122) Clarify and agree on the results.\\n(cid:122) Add personal observation notes.\\nConfirm the Situation\\n2-52. Start by orienting the subordinate\u2019s attention to the observed situation. State the situation and clarify\\nthat the observation is about leadership. Reiterate the information recorded: \u201cI\u2019d like to discuss the actions\\nyou took in the battlefield simulation you just led with your staff.\u201d [SOAR, Situation]\\nAsk for a Self-Assessment\\n2-53. Ask the subordinate to assess the situation and personal leader actions. Guide questioning to the\\nsubordinate\u2019s leadership during the event or situation. The subordinate\u2019s response should match the leader\u2019s\\nassessment. If it does not, the leader should ask additional specific questions:\\n(cid:122) \u201cHow effective was the communication between you and the subordinates you were leading? And\\nhow could you tell?\u201d [SOAR, Associate and Assess]\\n(cid:122) \u201cWhat factors did you observe that may have contributed to miscommunication or a vague\\nunderstanding among the troops?\u201d [SOAR, Associate and Assess]\\nClarify and Come to an Agreement\\n2-54. Leaders confirm the subordinate either agrees with the assessment or acknowledges a difference in\\nopinion if the subordinate does not share the assessment. Confirm agreement or acknowledgement before\\nproceeding to the assessment, linkages, and observations:\\n(cid:122) \u201cThat is what I saw as well\u201d\\n(cid:122) \u201cActually, in my observations I noted that you were directive in your message and didn\u2019t ask for\\nquestions. Would you agree that this is the approach you took?\u201d [SOAR, Observation]\\nAddYour Observations\\n2-55. Leaders may include observations that the subordinate is not aware. Leaders build on what the\\nsubordinate has already said to increase personal self-awareness. Specific behaviors that affected the\\nconsequence or outcome include\u2014\\n(cid:122) \u201cYour assessment is correct. When you asked for other viewpoints, good information sharing\\nfollowed.\u201d [SOAR, Observation]\\n(cid:122) \u201cIt was clear some staff had differing opinions or other points to add, though the opportunity to\\nshare really didn\u2019t arise.\u201d [SOAR, Observation]\\n2-16 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nGiving Feedback in 60 Seconds or Less\\nRegularly providing constructive feedback is important to ensure improved leader and\\nunit performance. Opportunities to provide subordinates feedback are available each\\nday. Review the conversation below for an example.\\nSituation: LTC Smith, the battalion commander, observes a platoon live fire exercise\\nAAR that CPT Phillips, a company commander, is conducting. After the brief, LTC\\nSmith approaches CPT Philips.\\nFirst, LTC Smith provides a brief situation description.\\n\u201cCPT Phillips, I was in the back of the room during the AAR. Let\u2019s talk a minute.\u201d\\nNext, LTC Smith describes the leader behavior observed.\\n\u201cWhen I came in, SGT Jones was describing some friction during the transition from\\nindirect to direct fires. You listened intently to the general descriptions and asked some\\nprobing questions to get more details.\u201d\\nCPT Phillips: \u201cYes sir, I want squad leaders to understand how important\\ncommunication is during transitions on the battlefield.\u201d\\nFinally, LTC Smith provides specific, constructive feedback to reinforce the observed\\nbehavior.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great technique to ask a few questions to confirm what SGT Jones said. He\\nsaid he had trouble identifying the conditions necessary to engage with direct fires.\\nYou noticed that. From the excitement in SGT Jones\u2019s voice, I think he knew that as a\\nleader he was in the right place to assist the platoon. If you had not probed for details,\\nthe outcome of that AAR may have been different. Keep up the good work.\u201d\\nWAYSTOFURTHERENGAGE LEADERS\\n2-56. Leaders raise questions that prompt subordinates to think about how to act or respond. Leaders should\\nask for recommendations about how the subordinate will take better actions in the future, avoid problems,\\nand take advantage of an opportunity. Here are some possible questions\u2014\\n(cid:122) \u201cHow will you handle a similar situation next time?\u201d [SOAR, transition to Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\n(cid:122) \u201cWhat future steps can you take to avoid this outcome?\u201d [SOAR, transition to Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\nReinforce\u2014Validate a Strength\\n2-57. Once the leader and subordinate agree on the behaviors that contributed to a consequence and a\\nrecommendation for the future, the leader should provide reinforcement on what the subordinate is doing\\ncorrectly. Here are some examples\u2014\\n(cid:122) \u201cYour influencing strategies are working for you, keep it up.\u201d [SOAR, Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\n(cid:122) \u201cConsider closing out staff meetings with opportunities for questions or discussion. Your pre-\\nmeeting planning and organizing is effective\u2014you should continue that.\u201d [SOAR, Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\nAdditional Tips for Providing Feedback\\n2-58. Consider these items when providing feedback:\\n(cid:122) Focus on the leader\u2019s behavior and actions.\\n(cid:122) Identify what the leader has control over to change.\\n(cid:122) Use focused questions as a form of feedback to create discovery learning.\\n(cid:122) Allow leaders the opportunity to produce a recommendation to the observation. This promotes\\ntheir taking ownership and responsibility for it.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-17Chapter 2\\n(cid:122) Be familiar with improvement actions described in chapter 4 and offer appropriate ones. Remind\\nleaders that this source is available to guide development, including improving their understanding\\nof positive and negative behaviors and underlying causes.\\nLESSONS FROM DELIVERING OBSERVATIONS\\n2-59. Leaders should avoid delivering some kinds of feedback. Especially important to avoid are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Vague and general ideas: \u201cYou are a good leader.\u201d Instead, focus on specific, observed strengths.\\n(cid:122) Using absolutes or generalities, such as always or never: \u201cYou never follow-up after meetings.\u201d\\nInstead, give specific behavior examples.\\n(cid:122) Observations applied to general traits or the total person: \u201cYou\u2019re an introvert.\u201d Instead, focus on\\nspecific, observed actions.\\n(cid:122) Untimely feedback that the leader is unable to apply: \u201cTwo days ago you gave ambiguous\\ninstructions atthe mission rehearsal.\u201d If they are not able to do anything useful with the feedback,\\nfocus on the future rather than the past.\\n2-60. It is important for leaders to learn from observation delivery and realize it takes practice. It is helpful\\nafter an interaction for leaders to reflect on their delivery. Reflective questions include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Was my subordinate receptive to what we discussed?\\n(cid:122) Based on my questions, how easily did they identify the behaviors that needed to change?\\n(cid:122) Did my subordinate ask for techniques or ideas on how to change or improve?\\n(cid:122) Is there agreement on the next development step and its timeframe?\\n(cid:122) Is there evidence that my subordinate is acting on the observations?\\n2-61. After delivering observations, leaders look for the next opportunity to observe the subordinate\u2019s\\nleadership. Then, gauge how well the subordinate received the observation, what steps the leader has taken\\nto change behavior, and what effect the change is having on unit outcomes.\\nSUBORDINATE RECEPTIVENESS TOFEEDBACK\\n2-62. Trust and a developmental culture are critical to ensuring receptiveness of leader observations. Leaders\\nperceived as genuinely interested in helping subordinates develop tend to have subordinates who are more\\nreceptive to observations and feedback.\\n2-63. To gauge receptiveness, leaders must remain attuned to verbal and nonverbal cues. These may occur\\nas verbal disagreement or resistance, or nonverbal gestures such as folded arms, rolling eyes, or lack of\\nattentiveness. These cues can affect an observer by increasing their frustration with the feedback process.\\nRefocus the subordinate and yourself by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Reaffirming your feedback intent maximizes the subordinate\u2019s capabilities to learn and lead.\\n(cid:122) Restating the intent of your observation as a chance for self-development\u2014not personal judgment.\\n(cid:122) Reiterating what went well, noting growth and progress.\\n(cid:122) Ask why they might not be receptive. For instance, \u201cIt seems you disagree with what I am saying.\\nCan you share what you are thinking?\u201d\\n2-64. Sometimes, a subordinate does not respond to any feedback. When this occurs, the leader might\\ndetermine if an underlying cause prevents a positive response. Ultimately, the responsibility for learning lies\\nwith the subordinate, but an effective leader ensures the best possible conditions are set for continued\\nlearning. Even in difficult situations, leaders use different techniques to gain the subordinate\u2019s attention and\\ncreate learning opportunities.\\n2-65. These are some ways to redirect a non-responsive subordinate\u2014\\n(cid:122) Work with the subordinate leader\u2019s subordinates and peers to ensure their actions do not affect the\\nmission or teammate performance.

Setting conditions and providing feedback and advice are two development fundamentals. Applying\\npractices to enhance learning makes development more effective. Enhancing learning draws on the\\ndevelopmental value from learning opportunities. Learning from experience is enhanced by facilitatingwhat\\nthe experience means. Understanding an experience requires interpreting the event to create personal\\nunderstanding. This process requires observation, feedback, dialogue, and reflection. A leader-subordinate\\npair, coach, or mentor can use these four steps with a leader, any group, or adapted for an individual learner.\\nThis section focuses on how dialogue can bolster the reflection process and understanding. Chapter 3\\naddresses how an individual uses this learning process. At the individual level, experiential learning is\\nlearning while doing. At the organizational level, experiential learning is improving while doing. Experiential\\nlearning is consistent with the principle of train as you fight.\\n2-67. Practical approaches to enhance learning include leader role models, mentoring, guided discovery\\nlearning, and individual and group study. These practices are not scheduled events but are powerful ways to\\nintegrate and promote learning in the day-to-day organizational operations.\\n2-68. Because leaders vary in their skill and experience level, an effective way to learn is directly from unit\\nrole models. Positive role models exhibit leadership behaviors that others should emulate.\\nThe 5-Minute Shadow\\nBring in a subordinate to observe or participate in an aspect of work that will improve\\ntheir abilities. To maximize the experience\u2013\u2013\\n-Communicate the situation, decision, or issue.\\n-Convey the importance of acting appropriately or making the right decision.\\n-Describe possible consequences, second-and third-order effects.\\n-Discuss the decision or actions and reasoning behind them.\\nGUIDED DISCOVERY LEARNING TECHNIQUES\\n2-69. Guided discovery learning is an advanced technique that experienced leaders employ to help others\\nlearn. Leaders use the technique in coaching, counseling, and mentoring situations. Guided discovery\\nlearning is an indirect method that engages individuals to identify personal strengths and developmental\\nneeds, supported by a senior leader. Guided discovery learning is effective when\u2013\u2013\\n(cid:122) A learner effectively makes sense of incoming information and integrates it with their personal\\nbase of experience and knowledge of relevant doctrine.\\n(cid:122) A supervisor generally keeps the subordinate on track through direction, coaching, feedback, or\\nmodeling.\\n2-70. When appropriate, guided discovery learning is more effective than prescriptive methods where the\\nleader prescribes problem solutions to a subordinate. Creating guided discovery learning options for a\\nsubordinate requires deliberate commitment from a leader to resource the learning experience, accept risk\\nthat they may learn a different lesson or learn at a different pace than the leader originally planned. Striking\\na balance between prescriptive methods and indirect methods requires a holistic understanding of how a\\nparticular Soldier learns and leads.\\n2-71. To facilitate effective guided discovery learning for subordinates, a leader ensures\u2014\\n(cid:122) Subordinates have sufficient background knowledge, training, and tools to experiment and learn.\\n(cid:122) Sufficient time exists to experience failure, reset training conditions, and learn from the\\nexperience.\\n(cid:122) The organization has a permissive learning environment encouraging learning without judgment.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-19Chapter 2\\n2-72. Guided discovery learning techniques are an effective way to deliver leadership observations. These\\nmethods are commonly employed when developing subordinates\u2019 leadership skills:\\n(cid:122) Positive reinforcement.\\n(cid:122) Open-ended questioning.\\n(cid:122) Multiple perspectives.\\n(cid:122) Scaling questions.\\n(cid:122) Cause and effect analysis.\\n(cid:122) Recovery from setbacks.\\n(cid:122) Experience.\\nPositive Reinforcement\\n2-73. A leader\u2019s first subordinate observations ought to focus on what they are doing right. Commenting on\\npositive actions up front shows a commitment to balanced and fair observation. It builds confidence and\\nconfirms productive performance that accomplishes an objective.\\nOpen-ended Questioning\\n2-74. Asking open-ended questions gets subordinates thinking about the situation and their leadership\\npertaining to unit performance. Broad questions maximize the potential for discovery. Leaders may need to\\nask additional specific questions if the subordinate is not identifying issues that need attention. An advantage\\nof this approach gives subordinates hints about what they may need to do differently yet allows them to\\ndiscover the actual issue on their own. In this way,responsibility for evaluation is with the subordinate, as is\\nownership for fixing the situation. Open-ended questioning is useful when the leader has time to listen,\\nreflect, and do something about the situation. Thus, the busiest part of mission planning or execution may\\nnot be the most appropriate time to ask an open-ended question.\\n2-75. Open-ended questioning is employed by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Identifying the outcome for the leader to realize.\\n(cid:122) Asking general questions about factors related to that outcome.\\n(cid:122) Asking specific questions and providing hints until the leader connects the outcome with actions.\\n(cid:122) Listening closely to the leader\u2019s response.\\n(cid:122) Confirming and reinforcing what is heard as an accurate assessment.\\n(cid:122) Probing further or offer outcome-based evidence if they are not accurately assessing the situation.\\nMultiple Perspectives\\n2-76. Employing multiple perspectives helps a leader see the situation from another person\u2019s perspective (or\\na different frame of reference). A complementary step to the decision-making process is to understand a\\nproblem and appreciate its complexities before seeking to solve it. Supervisors help subordinates reframe the\\ncurrent situation through open-ended questions or soliciting feedback from other stakeholders.\\n2-77. The purpose of multiple perspectives is to prompt subordinates to think creatively and innovatively in\\ntheir approach. Leaders should use this technique when a subordinate appears stuck with a limited way of\\nthinking or is unable to break away from a mental block.\\nScaling Questions\\n2-78. The scaling questions technique is useful in facilitating a leader\u2019s self-understanding of how difficult\\nor challenging a problem is in relative terms. It facilitates incremental improvement and helps one recognize\\nthat progress has occurred. Supervisors ask subordinates to use a 10-point scale (where 10 is highest or best\\nand 1 is lowest or worst) to assess personal performance on an action or competency behavior. The\\nsubordinate could share what they could do differently to improve performance a point or two on the scale.\\n2-20 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nCause and Effect Analysis\\n2-79. Leader actions are often several layers or processes removed from their consequences. The cause-and-\\neffect analysis is a method to identify the root (or original) cause of consequences and outcomes.\\n2-80. It is not always obvious to leaders how certain behaviors affect outcomes further down the line. Cause\\nand effect analysis is important because a leader and unit will continue to experience a negative outcome\\nuntil identifying and resolving the actual root cause. Many times, only subsequent effects (or symptoms) of\\na problem are addressed, leaving the root cause intact.\\n2-81. Leaders use cause and effect analysis to address shortcomings when limited time and capability exist.\\nIdentifying a root cause focuses on remedial actions to fix the problem and change the consequence.\\n2-82. Cause and effect analysis is facilitated through\u2014\\n(cid:122) Asking \u201cWhat (rather than why) causes it to happen?\u201d Show consequences or outcome data.\\n(cid:122) Continuing to ask \u201cWhat?\u201d and \u201cWhat else?\u201d until identifying all causes. It helps to capture work\\non paper or a whiteboard.\\n(cid:122) Depicting the relationships between causes and effect.\\n(cid:122) Identifying which causes, if changed or isolated, would prevent the outcome or consequence\\nreoccurring.\\n(cid:122) Identifying solutions or changes to implement without causing other negative outcomes or\\nconsequences to occur.\\n(cid:122) Coaching the leader on being proactive to avoid negative outcomes before they occur.\\nRecovery from Setbacks\\n2-83. When a subordinate experiences a difficult situation, setback, or seemingly insurmountable challenge,\\na supervisory leader can help restore confidence and prevent conditions from deteriorating. Employing the\\nfollowing enables recovery from setbacks\u2014\\n(cid:122) Reinforcing a strength\u2014a leadership behavior they are performing well.\\n(cid:122) Helping the leader recognize that they are already successfully handling some part of the task.\\n(cid:122) Asking open-ended questions to increase situational awareness and probe for solutions.\\n(cid:122) Providing recommendations if or when the leader is unable to arrive at a suitable course of action.\\n(cid:122) Increasing the percentage of positive reinforcement and support relative to negative reinforcement.\\nExperience\\n2-84. By virtue of position and experience, a leader often knows something is going right or wrong before\\nthe subordinate knows it. It is an art to know when to impart aspects of that experience to a subordinate.\\nLearning can occur by providing leaders with hints, well short of full understanding.\\n2-85. Leaders should carefully weigh the pros and cons of providing a subordinate with hints during training\\nexercises. It is important to allow situations and events to unfold without premature intervention. If the leader\\nprovides information or solutions to the subordinate too soon, the situation\u2019s development value diminishes,\\nas ambiguous or adverse situations compel leaders to adapt and problem-solve on their own.\\n2-86. Yet, leaders do not want to hold on to information that may inhibit learning during the exercise.\\nWithout hints, a subordinate may experience a situation and its consequences, but not effectively learn from\\nit. With hints and additional information, the subordinate launches on a learning expedition while the situation\\nis still evolving. The inquisitive subordinate will follow up on the leader\u2019s hints and find out why systems or\\npeople did not perform to expectations, a valuable learning expedition.\\nCOACHING\\n2-87. Coaching is a development technique used for a skill, task, or specific behaviors. Coaching helps\\nanother individual or team through a set of tasks or with improving personal qualities. A coach gets the person\\nor team to understand their current level of performance and guides their performance to the next level. A\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-21Chapter 2\\ncentral coaching task is to link feedback interpretation with developmental actions. Coaches advise an\\nindividual or team on what levels can be reached and what to do to reach them.\\n2-88. Like other development processes, coaching has several components:\\n(cid:122) Building rapport. The coach builds a strong rapport to facilitate trust and open communications.\\n(cid:122) Gathering and analyzing information. Review performance indicators or leader or team\\nperceptions to determine an accurate picture of capabilities.\\n(cid:122) Addressing the gaps. Discuss specific issues light of similarities and differences with typical\\nexpectations.\\n(cid:122) Narrowing focus. The coach guides the leader to identify the areas to strengthen and develop.\\n(cid:122) Setting goals. The coach assists the leader in establishing development goals.\\n(cid:122) Planning development. Together the coach and leader determine development paths, desired\\noutcomes, and specific developmental actions.\\n(cid:122) Promoting action. The coach sets conditions that help to sustain developmental action and\\nestablish accountability for development.\\n2-89. Coaches can draw on guided discovery learning techniques to establish and maintain rapport and build\\ncommitment. The coach tailors how directive feedback and guidance are depending on the situation and\\nperformance level of those being coached. Coaches involved in developmental actions should find a balance\\nbetween challenge and the learner\u2019s perception of ability to achieve incremental improvement.\\n2-90. To prepare for coaching, leaders study and apply the fundamental guidelines for leader development.\\nThey are passionate learners in the area being coached. They arm themselves with tips, techniques, and\\npractice routines to advise subordinates. Developmental actions for leadership include observing other\\nleaders, modeling what good leaders do, and practicing new techniques or approaches. Leaders can apply\\ntechniques in the conduct of their duties, look for different duty opportunities, or identify outside\\nopportunities. Other actions include reading, research, consulting, and formal coursework. Sometimes\\napplying different mindsets and ways of thinking provide enough development to meet established goals.\\nADP 6-22 provides guidelines for coaching (focus goals, clarify self-awareness, uncover potential, eliminate\\nobstacles, develop action plans and commitment, and conducts follow-up).\\nCOUNSELING\\n2-91. Counseling is the process used by leaders to review with a subordinate their demonstrated performance\\nand potential. See ATP 6-22.1 for more on the process of counseling. Counseling, one of the most important\\nleadership and professional development responsibilities, enables Army leaders to help Soldiers and DA\\nCivilians become more capable, resilient, satisfied, and better prepared for current and future responsibilities.\\n2-92. Regular developmental counseling is an essential tool for developing future leaders at every level.\\nDevelopmental counseling is categorized by the purpose of the session. Understanding the purpose and types\\nof counseling enables the leader to adapt the counseling session to the individual subordinate\u2019s needs to\\nachieve desired outcomes and manage expectations.\\n2-93. Professional growth counseling includes planning for the accomplishment of individual and\\nprofessional goals. During the counseling, leader and subordinate conduct a review to identify and discuss\\nthe subordinate\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and to create an individual development plan using DA Form\\n7906 (Individual Development Plan) that builds upon those strengths and compensates for (or eliminates)\\nshortcomings. Leaders can assist subordinates in prioritizing development efforts based upon those perceived\\nstrengths and weaknesses.\\n2-94. As part of professional growth counseling, the leader and subordinate may choose to develop a pathway\\nto success with short-and long-term goals and objectives. The discussion includes opportunities for civilian\\nor military schooling, future duty assignments, special programs, available training support resources,\\nreenlistment options, and promotion opportunities and considerations. Documentation of this discussion\\nresults in an individual development plan (see figures 3-1\u20133-4 on pages 3-7\u20133-10 for examples). Each\\nindividual development plan will vary as every person\u2019s needs and interests are different.\\n2-22 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nMENTORING\\n2-95. Mentorship is a voluntary developmental relationship that exists between a person of greater\\nexperience and a person of lesser experience that is characterized by mutual trust and respect (AR 600-100).\\nA mentor assists personal and professional development by helping a mentee clarify personal, professional,\\nand career goals and develop actions to improve personal attributes, competencies, and skills. A mentee seeks\\nand receives mentorship. Army leaders are encouraged to participate voluntarily in mentoring.\\n2-96. Age or seniority is not a prerequisite for providing mentoring. A junior individual may mentor a senior\\nindividual based on experience or specialized expertise. Having a mentor grows in importance as you become\\nmore senior.\\n2-97. Mentoring is a professional relationship. However, mentor-mentee connections are best when they\\noccur outside the chain of command. This is not contrary to a leader\u2019s responsibility to develop subordinates.\\nIt differentiates between the mentor and leader roles to develop, counsel, teach, and instruct subordinates.\\nSupervisors should refrain from appointing mentors or formally matching individuals with mentors.\\nParticipant self-selection leads to the most effective mentoring relationship.\\n2-98. Leaders foster mentorship by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Educating leaders in the organization on mentor responsibilities.\\n(cid:122) Participating as a mentor.\\n(cid:122) Inviting experienced leaders to visit and share their mentoring experiences.\\nMENTOR ROLES ANDRESPONSIBILITIES\\n2-99. Selection as a mentor is a compliment to one\u2019s professional abilities and competence. Table 2-9\\nhighlights general mentor roles and responsibilities.\\nTable 2-9. Mentor roles and responsibilities\\nRole Responsibility\\nEncouragement and motivation.\\nCandid feedback about perceived strengths and developmental needs.\\nProvides\\nAdvice on dealing with obstacles.\\nGuidance on setting goals and periodically reviews progress.\\nExperiences that contributed to personal success.\\nShares\\nUnderstanding the Army, its mission, and formal and informal operating processes.\\nAppropriate training and developmental opportunities.\\nEncourages Sense of self-awareness, self-confidence, and adaptability.\\nEfficient and productive performance.\\nAsa confidant, counselor, guide, and advisor.\\nServes As an advisor for career development ideas or opportunities.\\nAs a resource for enhancing personal and professional attributes.\\n2-100. Mentoring is a powerful tool for personal and professional development. Mentoring generally\\nimproves individual performance, retention, morale, personal and professional development, and career\\nprogression. Mentoring offers many opportunities for mentors and mentees to improve their leadership,\\ninterpersonal, and technical skills as wellas achieve personal and professional objectives.\\n2-101. It is not required for leaders to have the same occupational or educational background as those they\\ncoach or counsel. In comparison, mentors generally specialize in the same area as those they mentor.\\nConsequently, mentoring relationships tend to be occupation-specific, focused primarily on developing a\\nbetter-prepared leader.\\n2-102. Mentoring is crucial to development and retention. Once the relationship is initiated, the mentor has\\nresponsibility to\u2014\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-23Chapter 2\\n(cid:122) Share organizational insight gained through knowledge and experience. Showing mentees how to\\nmanage a certain situation is far more effective than just talking them through it.\\n(cid:122) Expand the mentee\u2019s network. Mentors advise on a spectrum of topics, ranging from specificskills\\nto broader career goals. Mentees gain sound guidance, access to established networks, and\\nenhanced personal and professional perspectives.\\n(cid:122) Help with setting development goals. Mentees often seek mentors to enable professional growth,\\nperhaps advancement in the organization or in changing career fields.\\n(cid:122) Provide developmental feedback. Giving feedback increases the mentee\u2019s self-awareness,\\nparticularly concerning strengths and developmental needs.\\nMENTORING RELATIONSHIPS\\n2-103. The appearance of favoritism or creating conflict with raters or senior raters should keep leaders\\nfrom mentoring subordinates within their chain of command. Subordinates should avoid approaching\\nsuperiors in their chain of command as mentors.\\n2-104. A successful mentoring relationshipis based on several elements:\\n(cid:122) Respect. Established when a mentee recognizes desirable attributes, skills, and competencies that\\nthe mentor has and when the mentor appreciates the mentee\u2019s attitude, effort, and progress.\\n(cid:122) Trust. Mentors and mentees should work together to build trust through open communication,\\nforecasting how decisions could affect goals, discussing progress frequently, monitoring changes,\\nand expressing enthusiasm for the relationship.\\n(cid:122) Realistic expectations and self-perception. A mentor may refine the mentee\u2019s self-perception by\\ndiscussing social traits, intellectual abilities, talents, and roles. It is important for the mentor to\\nprovide honest feedback. A mentor should encourage the mentee to have realistic expectations of\\ntheir own capabilities, present and potential position opportunities, and the mentor\u2019s offerings.\\n(cid:122) Time. Set aside specific time to meet; do not change times unless necessary. Meet periodically to\\ncontrol interruptions. Frequently check in with each other via calls or e-mail.\\n2-105. The mentee must be an active participant in the relationship. Mentees must\u2014\\n(cid:122) Prepare. Define desired goals for the mentoring relationship. Complete appropriate preparations\\nfor meetings with the mentor.\\n(cid:122) Develop. Work to improve.\\n(cid:122) Be flexible. Listen tothe mentor and consider all new options proposed.\\n(cid:122) Take initiative. Seek the mentor\u2019s advice when needed.\\nMENTORING BENEFITS\\n2-106. Soldiers and DA Civilians who seek feedback to focus their development, coupled with dedicated,\\nwell-informed mentors, embed the concepts of life-long learning, self-development, and adaptability into the\\nArmy\u2019s culture. The benefits are threefold: for the mentor, the mentee, and the organization.\\nMentor Benefits\\n2-107. Serving as a mentor provides many benefits, such as\u2014\\n(cid:122) Professional development. Becoming identified as someone who develops or mentors well-known\\nperformers attracts qualified, high-potential individuals looking for opportunities to work for the\\nmentor. Developing others to follow a mentor\u2019s example facilitates the mentor\u2019s own personal and\\nprofessional development and career progression.\\n(cid:122) Knowledge. Mentees are a source of general organizational data, feedback, and fresh ideas.\\nBecause higher-level positions isolate some executives and managers, mentees serve as an\\nimportant link in keeping communication lines open. Although mentors possess experience and\\nwisdom, mentees often provide important feedback about views at different Army levels.\\n(cid:122) Personal satisfaction. Mentors generally report a sense of pride in seeing mentees develop and a\\nsense of contribution to the Army. It is an opportunity to pass on a legacy to the next generation.\\n2-24 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\n(cid:122) Sharpened skills. Mentors sharpen management, leadership, and interpersonal skills as they\\nchallenge and coach the mentee.\\n(cid:122) Expanded professional contacts. Mentors expand their network by interacting with other mentors,\\nsupervisors, and various professional contacts.\\nMentee Benefits\\n2-108. Mentees gain tremendously from a mentoring relationship. Such benefits include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Increasing self-awareness through candid feedback.\\n(cid:122) Building confidence and encouragement to grow beyond usual expectations.\\n(cid:122) Having a role model and a trusted advisor.\\n(cid:122) Gaining better understanding of the Army and what is required to succeed and advance.\\n(cid:122) Gaining visibility through opportunities to try advanced tasks and demonstrate expanded\\ncapabilities.\\n(cid:122) Reporting greater career satisfaction with higher performance and productivity ratings.\\nOrganizational Benefits\\n2-109. The organization and the Army as a whole benefit in the following ways\u2014\\n(cid:122) Increased commitment and retention. Mentoring increases the understanding of how to reach the\\nnext responsibility level\u2013\u2013enhancing duty satisfaction and reducing reasons to leave.\\n(cid:122) Improved performance. Mentors and mentees have an opportunity to expand their technical,\\ninterpersonal, and leadership skills through the mentorship relationship. Mentoring helps mentees\\nidentify and prepare for roles which best fit their needs and interests. This enables the Army to fill\\npositions with the most capable, motivated personnel. Mentoring is functionally efficient, because\\ninstead of floundering on their own, mentors help mentees to develop career road maps.\\n(cid:122) Development. Mentoring increases the effectiveness of developmental activities that occur within\\nthe unit and generally produces leaders comfortable with senior level responsibilities.\\n(cid:122) Leadership succession. Mentoring facilitates the smooth transfer of Army Values, culture,\\ntraditions, Warrior Ethos, and other key components to the next generation of Army leaders.\\n(cid:122) Recruitment. An Army-wide mentoring program makes the Army attractive to potential recruits\\nbecause it shows the Army prioritizes its people and their development.\\nMentoring Skills\\n2-110. It is important to possess key mentoring skills to be an effective mentor. These skills include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Listening actively. Focus on the mentee\u2019s main points and whole meaning. Watch body language,\\nmaintain eye contact, and understand which topics are difficult for the mentee to discuss. Showing\\nsomeone you are listening is a valuable skill. It shows you value what they say, and you will not\\ninterrupt them. This requires patience and a willingness to delay judgment.\\n(cid:122) Holding back judgments. Reduce emotional reactions (such as anger or excitement) to the\\nmentee\u2019s comments. Do not immediately draw conclusions about whether the meaning is good or\\nbad until you are sure you understand the comments.\\n(cid:122) Asking the right questions. The best mentors ask questions that make the mentee think. However,\\nthis is not as easy as it sounds. Simply, think of what you want to tell the mentee and frame a\\nquestion that will help the mentee come to the same conclusion on their own. To do this, ask open\\nquestions that a simple yes or no cannot answer. Alternatively, ask direct questions that offer\\nseveral answer options. Then ask the mentee why they chose that answer.\\n(cid:122) Providing feedback. Do this in a way that accurately and objectively summarizes what you have\\nheard but interprets things in a way that adds value for the mentee. Use feedback to show you\\nunderstand what the mentee\\'s thinking approach has been. This is key to helping the mentee see a\\nsituation from another perspective.\\n(cid:122) Resisting distractions. Control the location and minimize outside distractions as much as possible.\\nFocus on the mentee.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-25Chapter 2\\nThe Value of a Mentor\\nMajor General Fox Conner served in the U.S. Army for forty years but is most\\nremembered for his legacy of mentoring a generation of promising officers, notably\\nDwight D. Eisenhower.\\nWhile serving under George S. Patton at Fort Meade in 1920, the two forged a close\\nfriendship and began preparing for the Command and General Staff School at Fort\\nLeavenworth by methodically working through the previous years\u2019 tactical problems\\nthe school used. Because of his work with Patton, Eisenhower was a serious student\\nof tactics when Patton introduced Eisenhower to Conner.\\nEisenhower accompanied Conner to Panama in 1922 as his chief of staff, when\\nConner assumed command of the 20th Infantry Brigade. Under Conner\\'s tutelage,\\nEisenhower perfected his administrative and tactical techniques by drafting formal\\norders for daily brigade operations and analyzing the tactical problems of fighting on\\nPanamanian terrain. Conner directed an intensive reading program that introduced\\nEisenhower to Plato and Tacitus; influential thinkers such as Nietzsche and\\nClausewitz; and various contemporary military writers.\\nDuring Socratic dialogues about the readings, Conner and Eisenhower discussed the\\nnature of war. One important subject often addressed was the difficulty of allied\\ncommand. Conner insisted the Treaty of Versailles made another war inevitable and\\nany future war would be waged by a coalition with the United States as a member.\\nBecause of these dialogues, Eisenhower was aware of the First World War\u2019s allied\\nmilitary command structure defects and pondered the question of coalition warfare as\\nearly as 1924.\\nSource:Dwight David Eisenhower: The Centennial(CMH Pub 71-40)\\nSTUDY\\n2-111. Leader development processes in the organization should establish an expectation for each leader to\\nspend personal time seeking knowledge sources and opportunities to grow and learn. If a supervisor\u2019s\\npersonal involvement and unit resources were always prerequisites for development, it would be a limited\\neffort indeed. Organization leaders should develop distinct ways to study their chosen profession and identify\\nwaysto improve the unit.\\nEncourage subordinates of similar positions or grades to form a community-of-practice group to\\nfoster excellence. Provide the groups reachback capability to web-based forums. Provide each\\ngroup with an opportunity to present recommendations or new methods to the leader team.\\n2-112. Encouraging professional development through outside study and engagement is a way to broaden\\nknowledge, experience, communication skills, empathy, humility, confidence, and an appreciation for\\ndiversity. Leaders can gain a deeper understanding of their operational environment and improve their critical\\nand creative thinking skills. While no limit exists to where leaders may find leadership lessons, mass and\\nsocial media have generated widely accessible options for all echelons of leaders. Some options are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Professional reading and writing.\\n(cid:122) Conferences, panels, and lectures.\\n(cid:122) Podcasts.\\n(cid:122) Online discussion forums, blogs, and social media.\\nPROFESSIONAL READING ANDWRITING\\n2-113. Professional reading broadens leader knowledge, understanding, and confidence. Leaders gain a\\nrefined understanding of the material and develop critical thinking skills through pertinent discussion with\\n2-26 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nothers. Discussing ideas and topics with peers, subordinates, and leaders who may offer significantly different\\nperspectives exposes all participants to new ideas and potentially broadens their outlook.\\n2-114. For personal reading, topics may come from established reading lists, stem from personal interests,\\nor follow from determining strengths and developmental needs. As part of a personal reading program,\\nleaders may choose to maintain a reading journal to take notes and record key passages, insights, and\\nreflections. When recording thoughts, leaders gain clarity, develop new ideas, refine existing ideas, and likely\\nshare insights with others. Journals can record related book and article titles for further investigation.\\n2-115. Documents often suggest related information to expand knowledge of the subject. The end of a\\nchapter or book may list related documents. The bibliography or footnotes identify information sources the\\nauthor used. To help narrow the search, note any reference that sounds interesting or relevant.\\n2-116. Individuals should consider writing for publication as a complementary element to a professional\\nreading program. Writing increases self-development as well as develops others who gain from the lessons\\nlearned and stimulated thought. Consider publishing papers created through the writing program in branch\\njournals or as blog entries. This shares ideas and gathers feedback for the author, which could be beneficial\\nin further developing the original ideas.\\nCONFERENCES,PANELS,ANDLECTURES\\n2-117. Conferences, panels, and lectures are a great tool for learning about new topics, observing panel\\nmember interactions, and seeing how lecturers communicate ideas with an audience. Attending professional\\nconferences and lectures in person can be time and cost prohibitive for individuals and units, but the advent\\nof social media and distributed academic lectures can provide a remote viewing option. The ability for leaders\\nto refine their skills at research, presenting material to an audience, and fielding questions or comments can\\nbe an invaluable way to enhance leadership and communication skills.\\n2-118. Knowing where to findconference schedules or lecture events can help leaders identify events best\\nsuited for their learning requirements. Military professional organizations, military history museums and\\nsocieties, universities and colleges, and professional journals are goodsources for lectures, conference panel\\ninformation, and previously presented content. Following these organizations on social media allows leaders\\nto stay updated about events that may be valuable as learning tools. Along with providing reading\\nrecommendations, leaders can provide recommendations for lecture series and panel events that may interest\\nand enhance a subordinate\u2019s development.\\nPODCASTS\\n2-119. Podcasts cover wide varieties of military and organizational leadership topics and can be used to\\nsupplement unit reading or viewing programs. Selecting a podcast for a specific topic equates to helping\\nsubordinates choose an appropriate book, journal article, or movie. It requires leader familiarity with the\\ncontent and the lessons they want a subordinate to learn from the content. Like verifying the credentials for\\nan article or author before including a work in a leader development program, verifying the content and\\ncredentials of a podcast host and their participants is equally as important. Multiple DOD and Army podcasts\\nexist to support professional development programs.\\nONLINE DISCUSSION FORUMS,BLOGS,ANDSOCIAL MEDIA\\n2-120. Online professional discussion forums, leadership-oriented blogs, and social media groups oriented\\non military leadership provide a wealth of mentorship and development opportunities and potential pitfalls.\\nOnline activities and social media are a constant presence in the daily lives of Soldiers, DA Civilians, and\\nFamilies. Understanding how various platforms work, to include who engages and how they engage, is\\ncrucial to Army leaders at all echelons. Soldiers live their lives increasingly online, which influences how\\nthey interact with their peers, leaders, and even the American people. This has real-life effects on an\\norganization\u2019s readiness, cohesion, and environment.\\n2-121. Social discussion forums range from professional discussion forums to informal discussion threads\\non social media platforms. Using professional discussion boards and blogs for leadership questions and\\nadvice can provide new perspectives, creative solutions, and connections between peers and leaders. Informal\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-27Chapter 2\\ndiscussion forums open discussion to a wider, and often anonymous, audience, providing risk and\\nopportunities for leaders and subordinates. Anonymity allows users to engage in frank discussion on\\nchallenging topics that they may feel uncomfortable discussing in person. At the same time, this can create\\necho chambers and subversive discussion that can harm team cohesion or chain of command. Leaders should\\nunderstand the potential for positive and negative professional development and dialogue.\\n2-122. Blogs and video blogs (vlogs) can promote accessible and easily consumable leadership and\\nprofessional development lessons for a wide audience. Professional military blogs and vlogs promote a faster\\nway for individuals to write, publish, or broadcast on relevant military topics. Like journal articles, leaders\\nshould responsibly promote consuming well-researched material. Blogs and vlogs offer multiple topics to\\nhighlight leadership concepts and lessons, even those that are not related to the military.\\n2-123. Army leaders increasingly engage their subordinates, peers, and senior leaders through social media\\nplatforms. See FM 3-61 and AR 360-1 for information and guidelines about building and managing unit\\nsocial media pages. Social media accounts typically fall into two main categories: organization-sponsored\\nsocial media pages or personal social media pages.\\n2-124. For leaders developing a plan to maximize their personal social media accounts, building and\\nmaintaining a personal social media plan can be invaluable to setting personal goals and limits for engaging\\nothers. Selecting the desired platforms requires an understanding of how to maximize the potential for each\\nplatform for individual engagement and development.\\n2-125. For leaders using personal social media to communicate ideas to a wide audience, understanding the\\nfine line between professional and unprofessional behavior is crucial. Using personal social media pages to\\nfeature family, viewpoints, and personal achievements and struggles provides an opportunity to highlight the\\nrealities of off-duty life. Being transparent and professional are not mutually exclusive for all Army leaders.\\nSocial media can offer a wide-reaching option to share the value of professional off-duty Soldiers and leaders.\\nSee AR 25-2 and AR 600-20 for information and regulatory guidelines to manage professional behaviors on\\npersonal social media pages.\\nSECTION IV\u2013CREATING OPPORTUNITIES\\n2-126. Creating opportunities for development or using existing experience opportunities is a fourth way to\\ncreate a development culture. An organizational culture develops based on shared values, beliefs, and\\nlearning. These cultural values, when consistent with the mission, affect an organization\u2019s performance.\\nLeaders foster a positive culture by providing a supportive command climate that values member\\ninvolvement and learning. Likewise, key leader position selections and responsibilities have implications for\\ndeveloping leaders far into the future. Integrating these efforts into a holistic program establishes lasting\\noperating norms. Developing leaders to this level requires investing time and effort but leaves a legacy of\\ntrained and ready leaders for tomorrow\u2019s Army.\\n2-127. Leader selection and screening can be useful in development efforts. Forming leader teams where\\nstrengths in one complement developmental needs in another is a common selection goal. Developing leaders\\nis often about preparing them for responsibilities in the next position. Creating opportunities for leader\\ndevelopment involves\u2014\\n(cid:122) Creating challenging experiences.\\n(cid:122) Sharpening leader selection.\\n(cid:122) Planning leader succession.\\n(cid:122) Tracking career development and management.\\nCHALLENGING EXPERIENCES\\n2-128. Experience is a developmental tool. Pressure, complexity, novelty, and uncertainty characterize\\nchallenging experiences. Leaders create learning opportunities by placing subordinates into challenging\\nassignments to stretch their thinking and behavior. Challenge creates interesting and motivating learning\\nsituations. Leaders create these experiences or ensure opportunities provide learning experiences.\\n2-28 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\n2-129. All Army assignments inherently provide some developmental challenge. Development happens\\neven if supervisors do nothing at all. Creating the right challenges in a position for a particular leader can\\ndramatically increase development.\\n2-130. Some missions or circumstances may not offer key developmental opportunities. Supervisors may\\nneed to shape position responsibilities to allow a subordinate to enhance personal leadership skills. Before\\nadjusting a position\u2019s requirements, leaders should consider unit and mission demands.\\n2-131. Leaders should be deliberate in placing subordinates in special missions and organizational\\nassignments. Experienced leaders implicitly know the defining tasks early in an assignment and should be\\ndeliberate about identifying these tasks and ensuring each leader gains experience from them. Sometimes,\\nsupervisors must assign subordinates to positions where they do not have the requisite skills or experience.\\nSupervisors should consider modifying position requirements and providing additional support or resources.\\n2-132. Not all leaders develop on the same timelines. Supervising leaders should be willing to adjust how\\nmuchtime each subordinate stays in a developmental position within the parameters available. Supervisors\\nshould involve human resources staff early as decisions may have implications beyond the organization.\\nWhen making such determinations, supervisors shouldweigh the effects on\u2014\\n(cid:122) Unit performance.\\n(cid:122) Leader team stability.\\n(cid:122) Leadership needs of adjacent units, higher units, and the Army.\\n(cid:122) The leader\u2019s well-being and personal growth.\\nIn determining what subordinates need to learn, ask them about the top three skills they need to\\nimprove unit performance. Doing so motivates them and increases their awareness about the leader\\nskills they need to learn.\\nLEADER SELECTION\\n2-133. Supervising leaders should foster an attitude that leadership positions are not necessarily automatic\\nappointments. It is neither a privilege, nor an entitlement, to serve in a leadership position. A leadership\\nposition is an Army requirement to fill a public need to provide for the Nation\u2019s common defense. Therefore,\\nleader selection fills the Army\u2019s requirement with individuals that will best discharge those duties. Selections\\nfor key leader positions require thorough consideration. Each step in a deliberate screening and selection\\nprocess should narrow the field of acceptable candidates:\\n(cid:122) Forecast potential position openings.\\n(cid:122) Identify key leader characteristics.\\n(cid:122) Build a candidate pool by working with higher, adjacent, and subordinate units, as applicable.\\n(cid:122) Use selection tools to screen out applicants such as\u2014\\n(cid:122) Conducting a career file review to identify prerequisite experiences and training\u2014review files and\\nrate candidates against career indicators.\\n(cid:122) Reviewing disciplinary or derogatory information in personnel or intelligence staff files.\\n(cid:122) Obtaining references or recommendations on the leader from trusted sources.\\n(cid:122) Conducting structured interviews with candidates for the position\u2014structure the interviews to\\nassess values, attributes, and responses to various situations.\\n(cid:122) Organizations may develop minimum prerequisite knowledge or skills requirements for specific\\npositions. Final candidates may demonstrate capabilities by conducting a task that proves their\\nqualifications for the position (such as leading a patrol or leading a convoy).\\n(cid:122) Select and appoint approved candidates.\\n2-134. If creating a qualified candidate pool is not possible, supervising leaders should consider modifying\\nthe position or providing additional support or resources to available candidates.\\n2-135. Consider the leader team when selecting leaders. For example, pair a technically strong warrant\\nofficer with a tactically strong officer. Pair a strong operations officer with an intelligence officer willing to\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-29Chapter 2\\nchallenge the operational plan by forcefully presenting the enemy viewpoint. Pair a highly experienced\\nnoncommissioned officer (NCO)with a less experienced lieutenant.\\nLEADER SUCCESSION\\n2-136. Succession planning is a developmental activity for individual leaders that focuses on deliberate\\nplanning to provide opportunities for experience in key developmental assignments and to prepare for future\\nassignments beyond the unit. Unit leaders may not have total input into succession planning but with\\nforethought can have plans to rotate leaders within the unit. Succession planning is a local system of talent\\nmanagement. Senior leaders plan systematic subordinate rotation within the organization so that trained and\\nqualified leaders are ready to assume vacancies, proven leaders move on to positions of greater responsibility,\\nand marginal leaders receive opportunities to improve. Succession planning serves individual leaders by\\nlooking beyond the organization\u2019s replacement interests. It helps develop leaders with the potential to succeed\\nin future positions beyond their current unit and returns a benefit to the Army by optimizing development\\nopportunities and duration across the unit\u2019s leaders.\\n2-137. Understanding the projected career paths and timing for leader branches and specialties is an\\nimportant factor in succession planning. Moving leaders into and out of positions should depend upon\u2014\\n(cid:122) Unit performance. Keeping leaders in positions long enough so that their stability promotes high\\nunit performance.\\n(cid:122) Army need. Providing experienced leaders back to the Army to fulfill its requirements.\\n(cid:122) Individual developmental goals and readiness. Determining when the leader has achieved\\ndevelopment goals and is ready to take on new responsibilities and challenges.\\n2-138. Supervising leaders should work with human resources staff to predict accurate leader gains and\\nlosses to the unit. Be sure to\u2014\\n(cid:122) Account for leader needs for career and position-specific training before position assumption.\\n(cid:122) Assess leaders during their initial assignments to drive subsequent position assignments.\\n(cid:122) Use leader vacancies due to schooling, special assignment, or leave as development opportunities;\\nassign less experienced leaders temporarily to the vacancies.\\nIdentify the key leader positions that trigger succession planning and management. Chart the\\ntiming and sequencing of leaders into and out of unit leader positions. Account for prerequisite\\nschooling and plan primary and alternate candidates for each position.\\n2-30 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nGrant and McPherson\\nDuring the American Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant rose to become the Union Army\u2019s\\nCommander in Chief. Along the way, he developed select officers to succeed him.\\nThose supported for further advancement showed three attributes: personal loyalty, a\\nwillingness to do any duty necessary to prosecute the war, and a desire to prove\\noneself in battle. One of Grant\u2019s inner circle gained his full trust and confidence: James\\nB.McPherson.\\nMcPherson was a Regular Army officer who graduated from West Point in 1853 and\\ncommissioned as an Engineer. Eager to find a combat assignment, he joined Grant\u2019s\\nstaff in January 1862 after promotion to lieutenant colonel. McPherson served\\nadmirably as Grant\u2019s chief engineer during the Fort Donelson campaign and at Shiloh.\\nA rising star, Grant promoted McPherson to major general in 1862 and appointed him\\nto command an infantry corps. His successes during the Vicksburg campaign\\ncemented his reputation. When Grant was promoted and sent east, he wisely\\ndesignated McPherson as commander of the Army of the Tennessee.\\nGrant knew the old army adage that \u201cbest friends may not always make the best\\ngenerals.\u201d McPherson had indeed become Grant\u2019s friend over the years. However,\\nMcPherson\u2019s ability to see Grant\u2019s goals and work tirelessly to meet them won his\\ncommander\u2019s full confidence and support. McPherson did not disappoint. While other\\ngenerals sought to seize ground and take cities, he endeavored to engage and destroy\\nenemy armies. McPherson\u2019s army was successful in driving the Confederates back\\nthrough northwest Georgia as part of Sherman\u2019s Atlanta campaign. Leading from the\\nfront, McPherson died in action on 22 July 1864. Grant memorialized McPherson as\\none of the \"ablest, purest, and best generals.\" Sherman called him \"a man who\\nwas...qualified to heal national strife.\" Even John Bell Hood, an adversary, marked his\\npassing with friendship and admiration. Yet while he lived, McPherson proved a sterling\\nexample of how to establish a succession of command.\\nCAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT\\n2-139. Individuals should understand and actively manage their own career paths while supervisors should\\nconsider the career paths and influence their subordinates to gain breadth in development. AR 600-100 directs\\nsupervisors to provide opportunities for a subordinate\\'s individual development. Commanders and other\\nsenior leaders should encourage their developing subordinates to take challenging assignments. Reserve\\nComponent leaders should be awareof subordinates\u2019 civilian development plan as this may affect their ability\\nto take on new and challenging assignments. The ability to see and select the best opportunities for themselves\\nrequires leaders to be equally proactive in advocating for subordinates who request selection for assignments\\nand references. This requires leaders to help subordinates account for all their career development factors,\\nincluding post-military considerations.\\nBALANCING ARMY NEEDS WITH PERSONAL CHOICES\\n2-140. Finding the proper balance between professional work and personal life while planning career\\ndevelopment challenges professionals at all career stages. The Army has experienced significant change with\\nintegrating women into traditional ground combat branches and efforts toward inclusion and diversity. This\\nfosters discussion and understanding about family impacts on a Soldier\u2019s career choices and Army impacts\\non families. Leaders draw on career experiences to help subordinates see how choices affect professional\\ncareers and personal lives. Acknowledging the interrelated nature of a professional Soldier\u2019s personal life is\\na key facet of fostering trust between leaders and subordinates across the force. Most career planning models\\nhave common steps\u2014\\n(cid:122) Perform a self-assessment to determine strengths and developmental needs (based on abilities,\\ncharacteristics, needs, responsibilities, or interest or goals).\\n(cid:122) Weigh the possibilities to choose goals and milestones for self-development efforts.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-31Chapter 2\\n(cid:122) Generate additional possibilities, goals, and milestones to align self-development goals to\\ndetermine opportunities or friction points.\\n(cid:122) Create an IDP that uses effective learning methods.\\n(cid:122) Implement the plans, overcome obstacles, and measure progress.\\nAsk organizational leaders to describe their most valuable leader development experience. Give\\nthem time to think about it before they respond. Have them briefly write about the experience or\\ntell their peer group. Use their experiences to help prioritize implementation.\\nProvidinga first, second, third, and fourth priority reflects the understanding that leaders may not\\nbe able to implement every idea or method. Some development methods provide a leader with a\\nhigher return in performance for less resource investment.\\nPROFESSIONALDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\\n2-141. Unit leaders are responsible for creating overall professional development programs, comprised of\\nspecific sessions focused on unit needs. Leader professional development programs are deliberate and\\nrepresent a cohesive approach to increasing the skills and readiness of the organization\u2019s leaders. Leader\\ndevelopment programs are an effective vehicle when consistently applied. Successful programs include\\ncommon elements such as\u2014\\n(cid:122) Mission-essential leader task training when a common needexists across the organization.\\n(cid:122) Required orientation or education sessions (such as equal opportunity and safety).\\n(cid:122) Cohesion-building activities to foster esprit de corps (such as dining-ins, sports, or adventure\\ntraining).\\n(cid:122) Opportunities for the commander, command sergeant major, or first sergeant to emphasize key\\nguidance to all leaders.\\n(cid:122) Education sessions on leader career path topics (assignments, schooling, or promotions).\\n(cid:122) Education sessions on the mission command principles, culture, and geopolitical issues.\\n2-142. Professional development sessions, conducted to facilitate discussion and collaboration, are\\nextremely valuable in gaining a greater understanding and applying specific information or skills in a unit.\\nThe information sources and means of conducting these sessions are endless and allow for creativity.\\nInstructors should not rely solely on dry briefings. Scenarios and materials should be tailored to the grades\\nand ranks present. These sessions are great team building opportunities to bring together groups of different\\nranks and responsibilities.\\n2-143. All these applications fulfill organizational leaders\u2019 training and developmental needs. To implement\\nleader development programs effectively, leaders should follow these guidelines (see Chapter 5 for additional\\ninformation and examples)\u2014\\n(cid:122) Link training and professional development.\\n(cid:122) Clearly communicate purpose and relevance.\\n(cid:122) Gather all leaders together only when doing so is the most effective learning method.\\n(cid:122) Consider prior listed applications as integral to leader development programs. Leaders can find\\nmaterials to support professional development from various sites, such as CAPL.\\nTo provide leaders with an in-depth perspective on a mission-essential task for the organization\\n(such as security patrols or convoy operations), supervisory leaders should lead the task in\\nprofessional development sessions while subordinate leaders perform the Soldier roles. By\\npracticing task execution to standard, the organization\u2019s leaders will be more effective at\\nsupervising future execution.\\n2-32 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nExample Session: Developing Mission Command\\nUnits that understand mission command principles effectively seize opportunities and\\nmake decisions consistent with commander\u2019s intent. Consider the following steps to\\nensure mission command principlesare a key part of the training strategy.\\nStep 1: Educate the unit on mission command principles. Members of all ranks need\\nto understand the principles and the need for each. Ask the following questions:\\n- Do leaders integrate mission command principles into training opportunities? If so,\\nhow?\\n- Do leaders specifically identify mission command principles when leading\\nsubordinates?\\n- Do leaders make subordinates aware that mission command principles exist within\\ntheir current roles and responsibilities?\\nStep 2: Ask the unit about the roles subordinates play in mission command. Have them\\ndescribe, in their own words, the concepts of delegated authority and making decisions\\nwith commander\u2019s intent. Ask the following questions:\\n-What methods do leaders typically use to delegate authority?\\n- What subordinate actions demonstrate good judgment while exercising initiative?\\nWhich do not?\\n- What opportunities do leaders give subordinates to demonstrate achieving the\\ncommander\u2019s intent?\\n- To what extent do subordinate responses indicate a clear understanding of the\\nmission command principles?\\nStep 3: Review your leader development program and modify as needed to ensure\\nmission command principles are regularly addressed. Consider how training activities\\nsupport subordinates in making good decisions when exercising initiative. While\\ncompleting the review, consider these questions:\\n-What does counseling look like in your unit and how can it be improved? Is it helpful\\nor is it just process?\\n-Does subordinate behavior suggest that commanders trust and support subordinates\u2019\\ndecisions?\\n-Do training events allow subordinates to improve upon their decision-making abilities,\\nin both predictable and unpredictable situations?\\nOPPORTUNITIES DURING TRAINING EVENTS\\n2-144. Training is an organized, structured, continuous, and progressive process based on sound learning\\nprinciples designed to increase the capability of individuals, units, and organizations to perform specified\\ntasks or skills. The training objective is to increase competent leaders\u2019 ability to perform in multiple training\\nand operational situations. Individual task training builds individual competence and confidence to perform\\nthese tasks to support collective training and operations.\\n2-145. Leaders contribute substantially to the unit\u2019s mission success or lack of success. Therefore, the Army\\ndevotes considerable resources to foster leader development during exercises. Providing leadership feedback\\nis a challenging, yet essential, part of training exercises. Leaders have a specific task to observe subordinates\\nduring planning and while executing missions. Understanding how to treat leadership as a skillset to develop\\nand improve is an essential contributor to mission accomplishment.\\n2-146. Where possible, leaders ought to use guided discovery learning. This places the observed leader in\\ncharge of their learning, with the chain of command in a supporting role. Using guided discovery learning\\nduring training exercises prepares the leader to be a self-guided learner in any setting. See Section II in\\nchapter 2 for leader performance descriptions at different proficiency levels to support observation and\\nfeedback efforts.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-33Chapter 2\\nMissed Opportunities\\nCPT Williams\u2019 company was tasked to run the battalion M2 range. Knowing the\\ncompany\u2019s high operating tempo while preparing to deploy for an NTC rotation, she\\nassigned the duty to her top performer, LT Taylor. She got several updates from LT\\nTaylor regarding planning and resources for the range; she led battalion range\\noperations before and understands LTC Cano\u2019s expectations. CPT Williams is\\ntherefore surprised when LTC Cano stops by.\\nLTC Cano: \u201cCPT Williams, I understand everyone is busy, but I feel you may have\\nmissed an opportunity to offer LT Taylor some much needed guidance concerning the\\nM2 range. While he had a very solid plan, there was some key information missing in\\nhis brief to me that I feel you would have caught. Did he provide a backbrief to you on\\nhis plan of action before presenting it to me and MAJ Blank?\u201d\\nCPT Williams: \u201cI did not require him to backbrief me, sir. I instructed LT Taylor to run\\nthe plan and his resource requirements by 1SG Diaz while I was focused on other\\ntasks. I did not take the time to bring him in for a rehearsal brief. Guess I hung LT\\nWilliams out to dry.\u201d\\nLTC Cano: \u201cThe mistakes were minor, and the plan was sound, however it is our duty\\nto prioritize development of our leaders, to show them, for example, how much rigor\\nshould go into planning, and how overlooked details can result in serious\\nconsequences.\u201d\\nCPT Williams: \u201cYes, sir. In this case, the fact that LT Taylor has participated in but\\nnever run an M2 range before, I should have prioritized supervision of the 8-step\\ntraining model.\u201d\\nCIVILIAN TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\\n2-147. The Civilian Education System is a structured program with central funding for all DA Civilians and\\nserves as the foundation for civilian leader development. DA Civilians have developmental opportunities\\nbased on their duty series, grouped into career programs. Each career program provides career-planning tools\\nto enable core competency development. The Army Career Development Program provides a planned course\\nof professional development by combining formal training and education with progressively challenging\\nwork experiences. See AR 690-950 for more information.\\n2-34 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Chapter 3\\nSelf-development\\n3-1. The gravity of the Army mission and the world\u2019s dynamic nature make continual learning and self-\\ndevelopment crucial to personal success and national security. Rapid changes in geopolitical affairs,\\ntechnology, and general knowledge require individuals to stay current. Army and civilian schools provide\\nbasic knowledge and techniques individuals need to review and update after they leave school. To thrive\\nprofessionally and personally, individuals must engage in life-long learning and self-development.\\n3-2. Self-development bridges gaps between the operational and institutional domains and sets conditions\\nfor continual learning and growth. Soldiers and DA Civiliansengage in self-development to improve their\\ncapabilities for current and future positions. Self-knowledge is an important part of a leader\u2019s development.\\nThe Army provides tools to facilitate leaders\u2019 understanding of strengths and developmental needs\\nthroughout a military career (see Websites within References). Institutional and operational training\\nassignments cannot meet all learning needs. Self-development is essential to attain and sustain the\\ncompetencies needed to perform successfully. Self-development activities reinforce and expand the depth\\nand breadth of what leaders learn in classroomsand on duty. Self-development activities enable achieving\\npersonal and professional development goals.\\n3-3. Self-development obtains the best results when it is planned, competency-based, and goal-oriented.\\nHowever, an important aspect of self-development is distinct from the other training domains: you are\\nresponsible for directing personal self-development activities\u2014not your supervisor or the Army.\\n3-4. Although engaging in self-development is a personal responsibility, leaders are responsible for creating\\nan environment in which self-development is a priority. Leaders need to be actively involved in developing\\nthemselves and each other. Self-development begins with feedback. Development happens through study and\\npractice. Leaders can support others\u2019 self-development through the exchange of professional development\\ninformation, discoveries, and opinions. As owners of their career and self-development, leaders are ultimately\\nresponsible for managing it. For example, you are the only one who can:\\n(cid:122) Assess your current career status, knowledge and skills, personal interests, and accomplishments.\\n(cid:122) Do you have the technical and tactical expertise you need?\\n(cid:122) Do you have the leadership skills you need?\\n(cid:122) Honestly determine your willingness to invest the time, effort, and mobility needed to advance.\\n(cid:122) Seek information about duty options, development paths, and training opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Set your career goals, develop a plan, establish a timetable, and monitor your progress.\\n3-5. Self-development supports planned, goal-oriented learning to reinforce and expand the depth and\\nbreadth of what a person knows to include themselvesand situations they experience and how they perform\\ntheir duties. The Army acknowledges three self-development types:\\n(cid:122) Structured self-development includes mandatory learning modules required to meet specific\\nlearning objectives and requirements.\\n(cid:122) Guided self-development is optional recommended learning to enhance professional competence.\\n(cid:122) Personal self-development is self-initiated learning to meet personal objectives such as pursuing\\na college education or an advanced degree.\\n3-6. The self-development process has four major phases\u2014\\n(cid:122) Strengths and developmental needs determination.\\n(cid:122) Goal setting.\\n(cid:122) Self-enhanced learning.\\n(cid:122) Learning in action.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-1Chapter 3\\nSTRENGTHS AND DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS DETERMINATION\\n3-7. The first step in determining strengths and developmental needs is to think about what you do and how\\nwell you do it. At a minimum, this information comes from self-examination. Examining personal strengths\\nand developmental needs is a skill improved over time. Feedback can come from formal or informal\\nassessments and from other leaders, peers, or subordinates. Outside opinions and information on strengths\\nand developmental needs are useful, however, admitting and accepting discovered developmental needs\\nrequires a leader to be open to accepting feedback and self-aware, which streamlines the self-development\\nprocess. Keep this in mind during a self-examination.\\n3-8. Understanding current strengths and developmental needs is necessary before setting self-development\\ngoals. This requires leaders to be self-aware about their leadership behaviors. These methods help identify\\nstrengths and developmental needs:\\n(cid:122) Formal assessments.\\n(cid:122) Feedback gathering.\\n(cid:122) Situation and self-analysis.\\n(cid:122) Strengths and developmental needs identification.\\nFORMAL ASSESSMENTS\\n3-9. Formal assessments, such as evaluations and tests, are a good place to start gaining insight into\\nstrengths and developmental needs, since they measure individual performance and compare it to a standard.\\nIndividuals use the information and results from relevant assessments to develop their full potential by\\nunderstanding personal strengths and developmental needs. Formal assessments also allow the Army to\\nunderstand the effectiveness of its leader development programs and improve processes through refinement.\\n3-10. Assessments can take many forms and provide insight on a diverse range of factors, including academic\\ngrades from Army courses, practical exercise results, self-reflection on duty performance, developmental\\ncounseling, official performance appraisals, multisource assessments, tests, or dispositional inventories.\\nSome of the more common assessments used by the Army are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Multisource assessments allow subordinates, peers, and superiors to anonymously assess the\\nleader using a standard set of items.\\n(cid:122) Army developmental assessments, such as the Leader 180, Leader 360, or Commander 360,\\nprovide 360-degree assessments of leaders measuring the Army leadership competencies. The\\nArmy uses the Unit 360 to compile individual-level multisource assessments to give unit leaders\\na holistic understanding of theirunit\u2019s leadership capabilities.\\n(cid:122) Army administrative or talent management assessments, such as the Army Commander Evaluation\\nTool, Army Leader Assessment Tool, or the Enlisted Leader Assessment Tool.\\n(cid:122) Intelligence and aptitude tests, such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or Defense\\nLanguage Aptitude Battery.\\n(cid:122) Personality or dispositional inventories, such as the Social Skills Inventory, Social Awareness and\\nInfluence Assessment, Self-Awareness Individual Differences Inventory, or Individual\\nAdaptability Measure.\\n(cid:122) Interviews.\\n(cid:122) Simulations or exercises assessed by trained observers or behavioral scientists.\\n(cid:122) Performance evaluations.\\n(cid:122) Counseling sessions (formal and informal).\\n(cid:122) Skills tests (such as the Expert Field Medical Badge, Expert Soldier Badge, or Expert Infantryman\\nBadge tests).\\n(cid:122) Tests administered in resident and non-resident schools.\\n(cid:122) Standardized assessments proctored during resident schools.\\n(cid:122) Field performance evaluations such as those at the combat training centers.\\n(cid:122) Occupational interest inventories.\\n3-2 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n3-11. Individuals differ in their abilities and assessing their knowledge, skills, attitudes, traits, or potential\\ncan be useful for development and talent management. Depending on the purpose, assessments have different\\nconditions for administration, use, validation requirements, and access to results (see AR 600-100).\\nDevelopmental leader assessments provide individual feedback to enhance performance for current positions\\nor to develop personnel to assume future positions of greater authority and responsibility. Results from\\ndevelopmental assessments are confidential and owned by the individual leader. Talent management\\nassessments support decisions about selection, promotion, placement, or assignment. When used\\nappropriately, valid assessments can increase the accuracy of personnel decisions. The Army owns the results\\nof these assessments, and the individual may or may not have access to the results. Assessments used for\\ntalent management purposes must satisfy higher legal and professional standards with respect to validity\\n(construct, content, and criterion), fairness, and reliability than developmental assessments.\\n3-12. Assessments are not a solution, but rather the first step in the long process of development.\\nAssessments provide individuals and units insight to help drive growth, better leverage strengths, and address\\ngaps or weaknesses. Assessments are useless without developmental action.\\n3-13. Reviewing formal assessments without experience can be problematic. Understanding how to combine\\nmultiple formal perspectives on performance to get a complete picture may challenge junior leaders. Reading\\nand interpreting evaluations and testing results is a learned skill. Performance evaluations provide a narrow\\nview of a person\u2019s overall leadership performance and potential, focusing on specific events pertinent to the\\nrating period. The language can also be misleading, avoiding subtle developmental needs in favor of\\ncondensed feedback for an external audience (such as promotion, selection, and retention boards).\\nPerformance evaluations, aptitude tests, and counseling sessions can provide skewed inputs if not taken in\\ncontext of a larger set of feedback results. Piecing together a performance pattern requires aligning\\nevaluations and tests from multiple sources, accounting for situational context to see patterns, and making\\nassumptions about strengths and developmental needs. Accepting and acting on feedback from assessments\\nalso requires a growth mindset to continually develop and reinforces the Army\u2019s readiness.\\nFEEDBACK GATHERING\\n3-14. Hearing what peers, subordinates, superiors, mentors, family, and friends think can help identify\\nunnoticed or reluctantly acknowledged strengths and developmental needs. Leaders get feedback by\\nobserving how they interact with others or asking directly. Supervisors have an explicit role in subordinate\\ndevelopment. Subordinates should consult supervisors for guidance about development goals or any other\\nself-development aspect.\\nObserve Others\\nObserving how others act toward you and the decisions they make affecting you give\\nan idea of what they think about your skills and expertise. Observing the same person\\non different occasions helps you see trends that may signal a firmly held opinion. One\\nobservation is not reliable, as that behavior may have been a result of other issues.\\nConsider the circumstances. What outside factors influenced their decisions and\\nactions? For example, if your supervisor selected someone else to perform an\\nimportant task, was it because you were too busy or unavailable?\\n3-15. After considering these questions, analyze the answers to determine the opinions that each person\\nconsidered may have of your strengths and developmental needs:\\n(cid:122) Supervisors, raters, and superiors.\\n(cid:122) Who gets the most challenging assignments?\\n(cid:122) Whom does the supervisor rely upon during emergencies or tough problems?\\n(cid:122) Whom does the supervisor praise the most?\\n(cid:122) What tasks does your supervisor assign to you versus others?\\n(cid:122) How does your supervisor react to your suggestions compared to others\u2019 suggestions?\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-3Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Does your supervisor listen to your opinions on certain subjects much more or much less than\\nothers\u2019 opinions? If so, what are those subjects?\\n(cid:122) Peers and subordinates.\\n(cid:122) Do peers and subordinates come to you for help or advice? On what topics?\\n(cid:122) Do they understand you or seem confused or overwhelmed by what you say?\\n(cid:122) Do they repeatedly ask for help or are they one-time interactions?\\n(cid:122) Does their interest and enthusiasm increase or diminish when they interact with you?\\n(cid:122) What does their body language communicate? Isit relaxed, apprehensive, or reserved?\\nAsking for Feedback\\n3-16. One learns a lot about others\u2019 perceptions through observation, but conclusions are only educated\\nguesses unless you ask others directly. To gain perspective, talk to others who know you in different ways,\\nsuch as rater, enlisted or officer counterpart, mentor, instructor, or family member. The goal is to find out\u2014\\n(cid:122) What they saw and their impressions of your action(s).\\n(cid:122) That person\u2019s impression of how well you performed during the interaction(s).\\n(cid:122) How you react in certain situations. For example, \u201cWhen a subordinate challenges your authority\\nin front of others, you seem to get flustered and be at a loss for words.\u201d\\nWho to Ask\\n3-17. These are items to consider when determining who to ask for feedback\u2014\\n(cid:122) Who has been able to observe you enough to offer useful information?\\n(cid:122) Who has observed you from different perspectives?\\n(cid:122) Who has experience in an interest area (former or current supervisor, mentor, or teacher)?\\nThings to Remember When Asking for Feedback\\n3-18. When asking for feedback, keep the following in mind\u2014\\n(cid:122) Respect others\u2019 time\u2014prepare questions in advance.\\n(cid:122) Approach with an open mind to accept uncomfortable or critical feedback without offense.\\n(cid:122) Listen carefully and respectfully.\\n(cid:122) Ask for clarification and examples when points are unclear.\\n(cid:122) Summarize the points to ensure you understand them correctly. Request permission to read points\\nback to the feedback providers for confirmation.\\n(cid:122) Thank the feedback providers for their time and assistance.\\n3-19. These ideas may help you focus on what to ask:\\n(cid:122) Get descriptions and opinions of your behaviors.\\n(cid:122) For feedback about a recurring issue, ask about the situation, your actions, and the usual outcomes.\\n(cid:122) Ask for suggestions for other ways to handle situations.\\n3-20. Look for common themes by comparing the received feedback to identify strengths and developmental\\nneeds. Army leaders must avoid the natural inclination to reject or minimize responses that do not confirm\\nself-perceptions or attribute them to a situation instead.\\nSITUATION ANDSELF-ANALYSIS\\n3-21. After gathering information from assessments, observations, and feedback, reflect on personal\\nbehavior and performance. Examining personal situations and experiences can reveal areas to change or\\nimprove. The situation analysis exercise helps analyze experiences to identify personal strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs. Determining what feedback is crucial to self-development can be challenging for junior\\nleaders who may receive more feedback than they can realistically process for analysis and development. A\\ntrusted mentor or leader can assist learning how to assess and develop.\\n3-4 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nSituation Analysis for Self-development\\nUse these questions to reflect and analyze experiences for insight into personal\\nstrengths and developmental needs.\\n-What was the situation? What happened? Who was there?\\n-What were you trying to accomplish?\\n-What needed resources or skills did you have or not have?\\n-What did you say or think? Were you able to express your point?\\n-What made you feel good (confident, excited) or bad (confused, worried)?\\n- What did you do? How did you act (including body language)? Why did you make\\nthose choices? Did you help or hurt the situation?\\n-How did others react? Did you adjust your actions based on others\u2019 reactions?\\n-Why did you act that way? What knowledge and skills led you to act that way?\\n- What could have helped you handle the situation better? Could you have used your\\nstrengths for a better outcome?\\n-Do you need to prioritize any developmental needs?\\n3-22. After recording the information, look for key factors that influenced the situation and overall outcome.\\nIf the same factor occurs in multiple situations, it may suggest a significant strength or developmental need\\nto develop. By knowing how personal actions, and the associated thoughts and feelings, affected the situation,\\nleaders can become more self-aware and choose the most productive actions. Additionally, a self-analysis\\nmay suggest broader interests to pursue or issues to avoid.\\nComplete a Self-Analysis\\nConsider these prompts while being as specific as possible to identify unique personal\\nstrengths and developmental needs.\\nStrengths\\nThe skill or ability at which I am best is\u2014\\nThe personal quality that I rely on most for my success is\u2014\\nI am most knowledgeable about\u2014\\nThe activities I look forward to include\u2014\\nI would love to learn more about\u2014\\nI am most proud of this accomplishment\u2014\\nDevelopmental needs\\nThe skill or ability that is always difficult for me is\u2014\\nThe knowledge or skill I require to be a better leader is\u2014\\nI do not know as much as I should about\u2014\\nI usually go to others for help on\u2014\\nThe situation that causes me the most frustration is\u2014\\nI am most hesitant when I try to\u2014\\nI am most concerned about my\u2014\\nCompetencies required for my current or future role are\u2014\\nSTRENGTHS ANDDEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS IDENTIFICATION\\n3-23. The final step is to analyze the information gathered from formal assessments, information gathered\\nfrom observing others, asking others, and situation and self-analysis results to determine strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs.\\n3-24. Weight feedback based on its frequency, look for recurring feedback themes or patterns heard from\\nmore than one person. Look at what others identified as strengths and developmental needs and compare that\\nto personal knowledge (from the self-exam) and formal assessment results.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-5Chapter 3\\n3-25. Usually, repeated success or expertise in a particular activity indicates a strength. These abilities may\\ncome easily even though others find them difficult:\\n(cid:122) What are favorite things to do or learn about?\\n(cid:122) What do others turn to you for help with?\\n(cid:122) What do recent assignments show as strengths?\\n3-26. Developmental needs are often tasks that are a struggle to learn or difficult to perform:\\n(cid:122) What was hard or not fun to do?\\n(cid:122) What knowledge, skills, and behaviors are required froma position description?\\n(cid:122) Did formal assessments indicate any deficiencies?\\n3-27. Identify where these descriptions apply and develop strengths and developmental needs lists. These\\nlists enable setting clear goals for self-development efforts and can be documented on an IDP.\\nGOAL SETTING\\n3-28. To maximize self-development efforts and avoid wasting time and energy, it is crucial to set self-\\ndevelopment goals\u2014identify personal and professional capabilities to improve and decide what to do.\\nCreating an IDP documents and allows tracking of these goals. This section outlines procedures to\u2014\\n(cid:122) Create and maintain an IDP.\\n(cid:122) Identify self-development opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Plan milestones to keep on track.\\nINDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS\\n3-29. IDPs span across the institutional, operational, and self-development leader development domains and\\napply throughout a career. They provide a framework to identify and document a person\u2019s holistic strengths\\nand developmental needs to guide self-development. In addition to strengths and needs, leaders are\\nencouraged to consider their physical fitness goals; their cognitive abilities to include critical thinking skills,\\ncommunication skills, and technical and tactical knowledge; and their leadership skills with a focus on their\\nself-awareness and ability to employ the competencies.\\n3-30. Once a leader has gathered feedback, completed a self-analysis, and identified personal strengths and\\ndevelopmental weaknesses, they are ready to document goals and a plan to address those goals using an IDP.\\nIDPs take leaders from where they are to where they want to be by incorporating short-and long-term goals\\nalong with action plans to address those goals. All individuals are responsible for developing and maintaining\\ntheir IDP as goals will change over time.\\n3-31. Figures 3-1 through 3-4(see pages 3-7 through 3-10) provide completed example IDPs. These IDPs\\nfor military and civilian members address short-and long-term goals, strengths, needs, and career planning.\\n3-6 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nFigure 3-1.

Understanding strengths and developmental needs determines where to focus self-development efforts.\\nIn addition to leadership assessments feedback, roles and responsibilities (personal and work-related), and\\nArmy needs can provide self-development opportunities.\\nRoles and Responsibilities\\n3-33. Work and nonwork roles have different responsibilities, skill and knowledge requirements, and\\nexpectations. Reserve Component leaders have a unique opportunity to improve both civilian and military\\nskills by linking self-development goals to skills shared by both professions.\\n3-34. Chosen roles usually reflect personal interests and values, but even assigned roles affect the value of\\ndifferent self-development paths. When roles and responsibilities align with talents and interests, leaders are\\nlikely to succeed and be satisfied.\\nAnalyze Roles and Responsibilities\\nList three to four important work and nonwork roles. Next to each role, list the two most\\nimportant responsibilities in that role.\\nIdentify knowledge, skills, or behaviors that enable better performance of these roles\\nand responsibilities.\\nArmy Needs\\n3-35. Another way to identify satisfying goals for self-development efforts is to align personal interests with\\nArmy needs. Soldiers and Army units must be ready to deploy and accomplish diverse missions. Some\\nrequirements may be unforeseen and untrained, requiring Soldiers to use their knowledge, skills, and\\ncreativity to accomplish missions. As members develop expertise, the unit and the Army become stronger.\\nThe expertise range and depth provide unit resiliency and an increased ability to adapt to specific challenges.\\nGeneral Stilwell\u2019s Commitment to Self-Development\\nEarly in his career, General Joseph Stilwell found he had a gift for languages and\\nsought opportunities to develop this ability. Before World War I, he traveled extensively\\non leave through Latin America and Asia, perfecting his Spanish and learning\\nJapanese and Chinese.His unique proficiency earned him an assignment as the U.S.\\nArmy\u2019s first language officer in China in 1919. In 1921, he volunteered to oversee an\\nInternational Red Cross rural road-building project to interact directly with Chinese\\nofficials and laborers to hone his language skills. After a year, Stilwell was conversant\\nin a notoriously difficult language and familiar with a culture alien to most Westerners.\\nStilwell spent most of the next 20 years becoming one of the U.S. Government\u2019s most\\ntrusted China experts. In 1926, he commanded a U.S. Army battalion near Beijing; in\\n1935, he became the American military attach\u00e9 in China. After the attack on Pearl\\nHarbor, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall appointed Stilwell commander of the China-\\nBurma-India Theater and chief of staff to Chiang Kai-Shek, the leader of Chinese\\nforces fighting the Japanese. Between 1942 and 1944, Stillwell deftly used his\\nknowledge of Chinese language and culture to build rapport with Chiang Kai-Shek,\\nensuring Chinese Nationalist forces remained a partner against the Japanese.\\nMILESTONE PLANNING\\n3-36. After establishing self-development goals, create milestones to get started and gauge progress. Use an\\nIDP to document goals and milestones. Milestones can mix short-term and long-term\u2014whatever personally\\nworks and encourages progress. Milestones should\u2014\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-11Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Be specific and measurable: They state what to accomplish so you know if the milestone is met.\\n(cid:122) Be meaningful and relevant: They should help achieve self-development goals.\\n(cid:122) Provide a challenge: Milestones should stretch personal abilities and be challenging to accomplish.\\nChallenging milestones increase motivation; being too easy or hard can hurt motivation.\\n(cid:122) Have a time limit: Time limits provide motivation and gauge success.\\n(cid:122) Be flexible: Build in some flexibility to overcome obstacles or revise milestones if necessary.\\n(cid:122) Be realistic: Ensure milestones are reachable with available resources. For example, if a\\ndeployment occurs in the next 12 months, do not set a milestone requiring college attendance\\nduring that time. Keep in mind that unforeseen obstacles may occur along the way.\\n(cid:122) Be cost effective: The benefits gained must be worth the effort, resources, risk, and other costs to\\nreach the milestone.\\n3-37. Every milestone requires at least minimal planning. After setting the first milestone, create a plan to\\nachieve it. A plan increases success by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Identifying all required actions.\\n(cid:122) Identifying the resources needed to meet the milestones.\\n(cid:122) Establishing time estimates and deadlines that help track progress.\\n(cid:122) Dividing large tasks into smaller parts to reduce being overwhelmed.\\n(cid:122) Identifying possible obstacles and the actions and resources needed to overcome them.\\n(cid:122) Maximizing personal time and other resources.\\nPlan to Meet Milestones\\nDevelop a plan by listing the first milestone. Identify the main steps needed to reach it\\nalong with associated timelines. Consider all the developmental resources the Army\\nhas to offer as well as other sources to reach each milestone. Identify potential\\nenablers and obstacles before beginning to better prepare for difficulties along the way.\\nCollaborating through online forums and interest groups may help personal\\ndevelopment and provide encouragement.\\nSELF-ENHANCED LEARNING\\n3-38. Self-development requires learning. Knowing how to learn is the most important skill required for self-\\ndevelopment. Self-understanding, setting self-development goals, and planning milestones all influence a\\npersonal ability to learn. Effective learning requires\u2014\\n(cid:122) Motivation and persistence.\\n(cid:122) Learning opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Effective learning methods.\\n(cid:122) Deep processing.\\n(cid:122) Learning through focused reading and analysis.\\nMOTIVATION AND PERSISTENCE\\n3-39. Self-development may require hard work over a long period, especially if the goal is to become an\\nexpert in an area or undergo significant personal growth. It takes motivation and effort to keep self-\\ndevelopment efforts alive. Genuine motivation provides lasting energy because it internalizes the goals and\\nthe desire to achieve them. Table 3-1 (on page 3-13) provides tips to stay motivated to make significant\\nchange.\\n3-12 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nTable 3-1.

Is their method appropriate to\\nyour goal?\\nReview what has Think about personal growth and resolved challenges.\\nbeen learned so far Learn from mistakes. Do not repeat them.\\nLEARNING OPPORTUNITIES\\n3-40. Learning stems from deliberate planned activities or unplanned experiences. Maximize each learning\\nopportunity, whether planned or not. Leaders embed planned learning into routine duties with typical events\\nor a separate, scheduled activity as learning opportunities. Take advantage of unexpected opportunities such\\nas cancellations or transportation delays by having appropriate learning materials available.\\n3-41. Unplanned learning happens when something unexpectedly captures your attention. Attune your mind\\nto draw attention to information related to self-development aims by thinking about developmental aims in\\ndetail\u2014what you are trying to accomplish and why you want to accomplish them. Review what you know\\nand what you need to learn. Review key ideas related to the subject as well as who the experts are.\\nPersonal AAR\\nPersonal AARs are in-depth assessments of how your leadership contributes to task\\nand unit performance. Leaders should conduct personal AARs by asking themselves:\\n-What happened and what were the consequences?\\n-How were my leader actions supposed to influence the situation?\\n-What were the direct results or consequences of my leader actions?\\n-How did my actions benefit or hinder mission accomplishment?\\n-How should I change my leader actions for better results next time?\\n-What did I learn?\\nUnit AARs clarify what happened and accurately assess mission accomplishment.\\nEncourage personal AARs following the unit AAR process by:\\n-Walking less experienced leaders through a personal AAR.\\n-Asking individuals what they learned from their personal AARs.\\n-Sharing personal AAR outcomes with subordinates.\\nEFFECTIVE LEARNING METHODS\\n3-42. The purpose of each learning activity determines the learning principles to use to maximize learning.\\nNomatter the purpose, general learning principles apply:\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-13Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Employ all your senses. Memory stores information according to the senses (how it looks, sounds,\\nfeels, tastes, or smells). More senses used while learning enable better memory and information\\nrecall.Involve multiple senses by taking notes, highlighting, reciting, and observing.\\n(cid:122) Space out learning sessions. Do not try to learn a large amount of information or a complex skill\\nin one long session\u2014break the material into several manageable sections.\\n(cid:122) Study the information or practice the skill on multiple occasions.\\n(cid:122) Know the time you learn best and study the most difficult material during that time.\\n(cid:122) Design learning activities so that they mimic reality as much as possible. If the expected conditions\\nto usethe information cannot be duplicated, imagine the conditions as vividly as possible.\\n(cid:122) Familiarize information through self-study before formal instruction. Reinforce learning by\\nreviewing the information after instruction. Review exercises memory skills.\\n(cid:122) When learning an entirely new field, go slow at first to ensure thorough understanding of the\\nbasics\u2014it is important to have a solid foundation to build on.\\n(cid:122) Learn in layers. Start with what you know to determine the first level of understanding,\\ninformation, or skill needed. Learn that level then determine what the information just learned\\nsuggests learning next. Each level builds on the previous and usually becomes increasingly\\ndetailed and interconnected.\\n(cid:122) Learn like a scientist. Scientists adopt the attitude that the best knowledge is subject to change and\\nthat new discoveries may prove old beliefs or assumptions wrong. Start the inquiry with a problem\\nor question. Find evidence that answers the question and test possible explanations to gather\\nevidence. Itis important to discover information that questions or refutes the possible explanations\\nto avoid confirmation bias. Analyze the evidence and develop an explanation.\\n3-43. While the general learning principles apply to all learning types, some learning principles apply based\\non whether the learning activity focuses on learning a new skill, a new behavior, or new knowledge.\\n3-44. Learning or improving a skill requires repeated, deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is not just skill\\nrepetition. Deliberate practice involves\u2014\\n(cid:122) Making your best attempt at performing the skill.\\n(cid:122) Analyzing the attempt results (sometimes with coach or instructor help) to identify ways to\\nimprove personal performance.\\n(cid:122) Attempting the skill again using the identified improvements.\\n3-45. Learning a new behavior about something requires repeated exposure to and testing of the behavior.\\nTaking on a new behavior might involve realizing that a prior viewpoint is counterproductive to obtaining\\ngoals. Changing behavior is done one of two ways:\\n(cid:122) Behave as if you have already adopted the new behavior. If done often with positive results, it is\\nlikely that you will adopt the behavior.\\n(cid:122) Observe another person behaving in a way that reflects the behavior. If you respect this person as\\na role model and see them gaining some benefit from the behavior, you may eventually come to\\npersonally accept and adopt the behavior.\\n3-46. Learning new knowledge requires linking the new information to already known information. This\\noccurs by deeply processing the information youwant to learn. The following section details deep processing\\nand the related critical and reflective thinking skills.\\nDEEP PROCESSING\\n3-47. The ability to learn and recall information depends upon what someone does with the information\\nwhile learning it. Deep processing requires analyzing the new information, picking it apart, using it, and\\nconnecting it to already-known information. Many ways exist to practice deep processing:\\n(cid:122) Relate the new information to something already known.\\n(cid:122) Accept that there may be a difference between new and previously known information.\\n(cid:122) Summarize the material you are learning in your words or diagram it visually.\\n(cid:122) Organize new information into categories.\\n3-14 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n(cid:122) Ask and answer questions to make new facts, ideas, and principles useful and important:\\n(cid:122) How does this relate to prior knowledge?\\n(cid:122) What does this imply?\\n(cid:122) What other examples do I remember?\\n(cid:122) Why is this important to me (or others)?\\n(cid:122) Where else could this apply?\\n(cid:122) Where or how could this be used?\\n(cid:122) Develop comparisons. What does the new information remind you of?\\n(cid:122) Explain or teach the material someone else to test your understanding and mastery.\\n(cid:122) Check multiple sources to gain complete, objective information. Argue both sides of an issue for\\nunderstanding to avoid an echo chamber.\\n3-48. Using critical, creative, and reflective thinking skills are essential to being an effective learner and\\ngaining subject expertise. These skills are essential practices to deeply processing information. Several\\nthinking types facilitate Army leader development and skills\u2014\\n(cid:122) Critical thinking.\\n(cid:122) Creative thinking.\\n(cid:122) Reflective thinking.\\n(cid:122) Strategic thinking.\\nCritical Thinking\\n3-49. Critical thinking skills facilitate learning assessment and problem solving. Critical thinking questions\\nwhat you see, hear, read, or experience. Critical thinking ensures the person is engaged in the learning\\nprocess, critically considering the information or skills practice. Critical thinking requires analysis,\\ncomparisons, contrasting ideas, making inferences and predictions, evaluating the strength of evidence, and\\ndrawing conclusions. It requires the self-discipline to use reason and avoid impulsive conclusions.\\nDeveloping critical thinking skills requires practice. (See ATP 5-0.1 for information on critical thinking\\nprocesses.) These questions guide critical thinking\u2014\\n(cid:122) Who or what is the idea source?\\n(cid:122) What is the evidence for and against this conclusion?\\n(cid:122) What are alternative or competing theories, explanations, or perspectives?\\n(cid:122) Why is this important?\\n(cid:122) What are the implications?\\n(cid:122) Is the argument logic or reasoning sound?\\n(cid:122) Do the numbers, quantities, and calculations make sense?\\n(cid:122) Do the supporting facts agree with other sources?\\n(cid:122) Why or how does this work?\\n(cid:122) How likely is this?\\nCreative Thinking\\n3-50. Creative thinking involves examining problems from a fresh perspective to develop innovative\\nsolutions. Creative thinking occurs by consciously generating new ideas and re-evaluating or combining old\\nideas to solve a problem. Creativity is a willingness to accept change and apply a flexible outlook for multiple\\nperspectives, new ideas, and possibilities.\\n3-51. Identifying hidden assumptions is useful for developing greater creativity and insight. Producing\\nreasons against a preferred conclusion or option instead of favoring that conclusion or option improves\\nthorough reasoning and identifies possible contingencies. Imagine what causes a speculative conclusion to\\nbe incorrect. Considering ways something would not be true allows determining other possible situational\\naspects and ways to shape the outcome to avoid those undesired states.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-15Chapter 3\\nFinding hidden assumptions or imagining failure are similar techniques that protect against group\\nthink and hasty agreement with conventional wisdom. Think about what could cause failure. Those\\ncauses are likely assumptions that were not evident. Identifying hidden assumptions can mitigate\\nthe risk of an incorrect assessment.\\nReflective Thinking\\n3-52. Closely related to critical thinking, reflective thinking seeks to build understanding, interpret\\nexperiences, and resolve questions. Reflective thinking requires thinking through the gathered information\\nin detail to organize it, apply principles, make connections, and form conclusions. Table 3-2 provides\\nexample questions to help leaders reflect on their thinking and develop better judgment.\\nTable 3-2.Reflective question examples\\nWhat does this information mean?\\nWhat conclusions can be drawn from this?\\nHow is this information used?\\nFor organizing\\nHow does this fit with my existing knowledge and experiences?\\npersonal\\nWhat are the implications for others or me?\\nthoughts ask:\\nWhat is the big picture and how does this fit into it?\\nWhat is the best way to learn about this subject?\\nWhere should this take me in my studies and self-development?\\nWhat is this situation?\\nWhat other situation is like this one?\\nWhat is this situation not like?\\nFor improved\\nWhat do I know about situations like this?\\nunderstanding\\nHow could this situation happen?\\nask:\\nHow should I think about this situation to define the problem or opportunity?\\nWhat is the real problem?\\nWhat do I not know that I should?\\nWhat else could this situation or solution be?\\nAre any assumptions unneeded; are new ones needed?\\nFor improved\\nWhat constraints are there?\\nvisualization\\nWhat needs to be accomplished?\\nask:\\nWhat is likely to happen?\\nHowshould I prepare for future situations?\\nWhat is the solution or plan?\\nFor improved\\nDoes one solution dominate others? Can the solution be redesigned so that it does?\\ndecision-\\nIs there a specific way to reason and decide about the solution?\\nmaking ask:\\nWhat would my enemy not want me to do?\\nCritical, Creative, and Reflective Thinking Development\\n3-53. Critical and creative thinking come together as practical thinking that captures the strengths of how\\npeople approach everyday problems. Critical thinking brings out differences that are not normally obvious.\\nCreative thinking techniques help generate new insights. Both thinking types fill in knowledge gaps and\\nresolve uncertainty. Practical thinking signs include a willingness to try alternate approaches to thinking,\\nbeing open to others\u2019 positions, being prepared to think about issues instead of ignoring or dismissing them\\nand asking insightful questions.\\n3-54. Leaders must develop critical and creative thinking in team members. The ability and capacity for\\nintellectual and critical thought are essential to effective problem solving. Subordinates\u2019 actions, based on\\n3-16 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\ntheir critical thinking skills, often dictate team success. An excellent way to develop critical thinking in an\\norganization is through example, by being a critical thinker. Thinking critically and setting conditions that\\nencourage others to think critically effectively enhance the process.\\n3-55. How people think and feel about learning affects their thinking and judgment development. For\\nexample, an attitude that thinking can resolve problems leads to better results in overcoming difficulties\\nthrough thinking. Attitudes that conflict with sound thinking should be diminished, such as changing one\u2019s\\nmind is a sign of weakness, being open and deliberating among options leads to confusion, quick decision-\\nmaking is how one demonstrates expertise, or truth comes from authority.\\n3-56. Positive attitudes that contribute to developing critical and creative thinking include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Persistence. If one line of thought or action is not working, then finding another line may work.\\n(cid:122) Willingness to expend effort. A willingness to engage in deeper, more thorough thinking is\\nimportant for critical thinking, even when the effort may not initially seem useful.\\n(cid:122) Active fair-mindedness. Making special effort to find out whether one\u2019s ideas will work by\\nimagining what is wrong with them is a good way to be fair-minded. Using the same standards,\\nregardless of the issue or who supports a position is another fair-mindedness quality.\\n(cid:122) Ego detachment. Keeping reasoning separate from self-esteem helps guard against being caught\\nup in being on the right side of an argument or rationalizing why failure was out of one\u2019s control.\\n(cid:122) Uncertainty tolerance. Believing it is fine not to know something is a positive characteristic. Yet,\\nmotivation to resolve uncertainty, once recognized, is even more important. Thinking through\\nproblems, instead of using minimal cues to interpret a situation incorrectly, is an advantage.\\n(cid:122) Openness. Being open to different and multiple possibilities leads to better decisions.\\n(cid:122) Commitment retraction. Willing to change beliefs about a preferred solution or a problem\\nviewpoint is an attitude that has positive effects.\\n(cid:122) Process flexibility. Realize that standard processes will not work for novel, ill-defined, or complex\\nproblems. Adapting or discovering a new way to think may help reach a solution.\\n(cid:122) Willingness to learn. It is natural for leaders to feel an expectation to have the knowledge and\\nexperience to perform well. Being willing to engage in learning is adaptive. One expert\\ncharacteristic is that they understand what they know and what they need to learn.\\n3-57. Thinking ahead and predicting potential ways that a situation assessment may be wrong or that a course\\nof action could depart from the anticipated plan prepares leaders to handle the unknown. Having identified\\nand worked through various contingencies better prepares the team for what could occur.\\nStrategic Thinking\\n3-58. Strategic thinking is an imperative for military leaders to shape the future of operations and to steward\\navailable resources. Strategic thinking is valuable at all leadership levels. It is important to consider the\\noverall situation and make decisions that set the stage for plans lasting years. Strategic thinking generates a\\ncohesive understanding of situational dynamics presenting advantageous options and long-term\\norganizational success. Thinking skills and activities directed at outcomes that produce an overarching\\napproach or plan to achieve a particular aim characterize strategic thinking. In this case strategic describes\\nthe thinking type rather than the doctrinal usage to describe a level of war, security objectives, or ideas to\\nemploy the instruments of national power. In contrast to thinking following traditional problem-solving steps,\\nstrategic thinking is not looking to solve a bounded problem but is creating a decision set or pattern to achieve\\nfuture success. While a tactic specifically prescribes how something is done, a strategy is a philosophy of\\nwhat is valued andconsists of guidelines or boundaries to shape what actions to take.\\n3-59. Clearly, strategic thinking is an important skill for senior leaders to establish high-level goals and\\nbroadly scoped policies. However, strategic thinking is important for junior-level leaders when they address\\nrecurring problems and consider enduring, robust solutions. The earlier leaders are exposed to strategic\\nthinking, the more likely they will try it, apply it, and, over time, improve.\\n3-60. Strategic thinking can be broken down into several activities:\\n(cid:122) Situational understanding. Scanning for recurring, novel, and key cues integrated and used in\\nsensemaking, predicting, and testing what exists enable understanding. Visualization is a related\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-17Chapter 3\\nactivity to fill in knowledge gaps about existing or future considerations. Subskills include\\ndiscriminating among relevant cues, integrating diverse information, applying mental war-\\ngaming, and modeling.\\n(cid:122) Questioning. Asking questions demonstrates an openness to different perspectives and a desire to\\nconsider alternate or unconventional assessments. Questioning, a key component of thinking\\ncritically, improves the thoroughness of judgment. Consistently demonstrating a willingness to\\nshift perspective, search for alternate explanations, and avoid mindsets and fixations characterize\\ncognitive flexibility.\\n(cid:122) Systems thinking. Systems thinking involves considering the factors of a situation or a solution as\\nan interrelated system with inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback. A systems orientation\\noperates from a view that an understanding or model can be created to explain or improve what\\noccurs (as applies to situational understanding) or what could occur (as applies to problem\\nsolving). See Army Design Methodology doctrine for more about systems thinking.\\n(cid:122) Analogical reasoning. Thinking that deals with complex problems with unfamiliar or unknown\\nconditions and outcomes occurs by drawing on current knowledge. Analogical reasoning is a\\nspecific approach where known or similar concepts and relationships map to what is yet not\\nunderstood. Historical comparisons are useful in strategic thinking to consider what has occurred\\nunder one known condition set.\\n(cid:122) Self-awareness. Since strategic thinking involves unknowns, multiple paths, trials of what might\\nexist in a situation, and possible solution results, an ability to manage personal thought processes\\nis important. Metacognition is being aware of what oneself is thinking, what one knows, progress\\ntoward a conclusion, and testing strategic approaches and conclusions aboutthem.\\n3-61. Developing strategic thinking occurs by addressing complex, dynamic challenges while practicing\\ncritical and creative thinking, working in context, and gaining basic skills in situational understanding and\\nvisualization. Leaders or instructors can accelerate subordinates\u2019 thinking development by assigning projects\\nor duties with opportunities for strategic thinking. Professional military education courses reinforce strategic\\nthinking by assigning projects requiring skills application and grading how well a student employs them.\\nAmbiguous or Unfamiliar Situations\\n3-62. Deliberate effort applied to thinking is a way to provide best guesses about ambiguity\u2014uncertain\\nsituations, uncertain actions by an adversary, and uncertain outcomes. One way to prepare is to have a\\nstandard question set to ask when faced with uncertainty. Developing a practice of asking questions prompts\\nadditional reasoning. Table 3-3 provides some example questions to focus thinking.\\nTable 3-3. Example questions to focus thinking\\nQuestion prompt Example\\nWhat if\u2026? What if\u2026this assessment was not the case?\\nWhat else\u2026? What else\u2026is happening?\\nSo what? So, what if that happened\u2026is there a meaningful difference?\\nWhat are the specifics? Can claims be confirmed with specific information?\\nIs there a weak link? Are there any inconsistencies or confusions?\\nWhat is unexpected? Are there new conclusions or implications?\\n3-63. It is natural to discount information when it does not fit expectations. Some refer to this as confirmation\\nbias, but that reference implies a conscious or active process when it usually is not. It is difficult to undo\\nsomeone\u2019s assessment or conclusion once it forms. The first step to protect against discounting unexpected\\nsignals is to pay attention to information that does not fit expectations. Assessing the information can indicate\\nwhether an understanding needs to change. If no definite determination is possible, even heightened vigilance\\nfor change should occur.\\n3-64. The dominance structuring technique is a useful way to problem solve to ensure the best available\\nsolution is considered and chosen. Leaders can use the dominance structuring technique in a formal military\\ndecision-making process. It is a way of thinking to iterate through course of action development, analysis,\\ncomparison, and wargaming. The technique adapts to time available and known details.\\n3-18 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nDominance Structuring Technique\\nFirst, consider the relevant problem dimensions. Look for the solution that dominates\\nall other possible solutions on the most important dimensions.\\nIdentify the initial most promising alternative solution by eliminating alternative\\nsolutions that are unattractive on important dimensions.\\nChoose an alternative if it is better than all others on at least one dimensionand equal\\nto other options on other dimensions. This will be the dominant solution.\\nIf the most promising alternative does not initially dominate all other alternatives, then\\nreconsider advantages and disadvantages.\\nIf necessary and when possible, modify the most promising alternative until it\\ndominates other alternatives. This will be the dominant solution. If no dominant solution\\nappears, reconsider the most important problem dimensions to repeat the dominance\\ncomparisons among alternatives.\\nLEARNING THROUGH FOCUSED CONTENT ANALYSIS\\n3-65. Books, journal articles, lecture series, podcasts, documentaries, movies, professional panel discussions\\nmay be key learning resources for self-development. To maximize learning, approach consuming content for\\nlearning differently than casual content consumption. Deep processing is essential to the ability to understand,\\nrecall, and use the learned information. Even though a book or professional lecture may present information\\nin a logical way, the learner must take an active role to understand the information.\\n3-66. The Survey-Question-Read-Recite-Review method uses deep processing principles to focus content\\nanalysis. Developed over 70 years ago, these activities comprise a most widely recommended and effective\\nway to learn from written materials. This same method can also extend to other materials, such as analyzing\\na professional lecture series or documentary.\\n3-67. Survey. Scan the chapter, article, lecture notes, video comments, or other material to build a mental\\nmaterial framework or outline and establish a purpose for consuming it. This mental framework will help\\nunderstanding the material\u2019s purpose, set expectations to draw attention to important information, activate\\nmemory of what is already known, and develop a skeleton of understanding. Survey the material by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Predicting discussion topics. Complete accuracy is not necessary, but it helps active understanding\\nof the material.\\n(cid:122) Noting the title, topic sequence, and their relationships.\\n(cid:122) Looking at graphs, charts, diagrams, and pictures and read their captions.\\n(cid:122) Reading and verifying quotations, vignettes, and other short statements.\\n(cid:122) Scanning footnotes, references used, and presenter history and credentials to sense where ideas\\ncome from or what they mean.\\n(cid:122) Noting emphasized words and phrases.\\n(cid:122) Reading the introduction, abstract, and summary if available.\\n(cid:122) Reviewing other aids that the material may have, such as study guides, advance organizers, chapter\\noutlines, learning objectives, or review questions.\\n(cid:122) Deciding what to learn from the material.\\n3-68. Question. While surveying the material, list questions you want to answer while consuming the\\nmaterial. Developing questions to guide your study increases interest in the material, alerts you to important\\ninformation, helps you stay involved with the material, and relates the new knowledge to what you already\\nknow. To develop questions\u2014\\n(cid:122) Turn the title or headings into questions. For example, if a heading is \u201cThe Four-Step Calibration\\nProcess,\u201d a question may be, \u201cWhat are the four calibration process steps?\u201d\\n(cid:122) Ask questions about graphs, charts, diagrams, and pictures. For example, a graph showing an\\nincreasing rate of traffic fatalities in the United States could lead to the question, \u201cWhy have traffic\\nfatalities increased in the United States?\u201d\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-19Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Consider questions that the author or presenter includes such as in call-out boxes or review\\nquestions. Rephrase these questions so that they are meaningful and easier to remember.\\n3-69. Read (View or Listen). Consume the material one section at a time. Engage several senses by reading,\\nlistening, watching, or taking notes. These tips aid understanding, retain interest, and retain information:\\n(cid:122) Look for the answers to your questions and write them in your words.\\n(cid:122) Look for additional questions to answer and important information that you had not anticipated.\\n(cid:122) Use deep processing to relate the new information to things you already know.\\n(cid:122) Note important information, especially information that answers questions you wrote.\\n(cid:122) Make diagrams that show how a process works, timelines, event sequences, or the relationships\\nthat exist between different components.\\n(cid:122) Respond to points by noting ideas in the margins, a separate notebook, or device. This personalizes\\nthe information and relates it to information already known. For example, notes may highlight\\ndisagreements, how a stated idea relates to another idea learned elsewhere, gaps or questions that\\nremain in the information, or information implications.\\n(cid:122) Look for connections, discrepancies, comparisons, and relationships between information\\npresented in the document and other readings, lectures, or personal experiences.\\n3-70. Recite. Reciting tests knowledge and information understanding. Self-testing is a method of deep\\nprocessing to enhance memory. Reciting helps minimize knowledge gaps.\\n(cid:122) Stop reading or listening at the end of each section and summarize the material from memory.\\n(cid:122) Ask the questions you previously wrote for that section.\\n(cid:122) Explain charts, graphs, diagrams without referring to personal notes.\\n(cid:122) Review the section until you can recite its important information and concepts.\\n3-71. Review. Reviewing helps refresh and strengthen memory and material mastery.\\n(cid:122) Review the material immediately. Review again in 24 hours and again several days later.\\n(cid:122) Review your written questions and see if you cananswer them. Study the material to answer any\\nmissed questions.\\n(cid:122) Explain how all the sections fit together. What are the overarching points and principles?\\n(cid:122) Explain how the information in this document relates to self-development goals.\\n(cid:122) Interaction with a friend or coworker who has studied the same information can help maintain\\nfocus, provide different perspectives on the material, and clarify difficult or misunderstood points.\\nREFLECTIVE JOURNALING\\n3-72. Journaling may track and record the occurrence, actions, and outcomes of various situations. Reflective\\njournaling goes beyond a personal AAR to include periodic entries on self-awareness of personal strengths,\\ndevelopmental needs, values, feelings and perceptions, and questions and ideas about leadership situations.\\nA leader may track personal successes and lessons learned by dedicating time to recording their experiences\\nin leading others, chosen actions, resulting outcomes, and any insights. The journal may serve as a reference\\nto pass along lessons learned to others. Key leader references may be recorded.\\n3-73. Sample reflective journaling questions include:\\n(cid:122) What is the best thing that happened today or this week?\\n(cid:122) What is my most difficult or satisfying work? Why?\\n(cid:122) What do I think is my most valuable or valued contribution?\\n(cid:122) What compliments and criticisms have I received lately? What did I learn from them?\\n(cid:122) What did I learn due to a recent disappointment or failure?\\n(cid:122) How do recent experiences connect to my long-term goals?\\n(cid:122) What risks have I taken (or avoided taking) lately?\\n3-74. Individual leaders should decide whether to share their journal content with their immediate leader or\\nothers. Leaders can reinforce reflective journaling by\u2014\\n3-20 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n(cid:122) Carrying a journal and being seen writing.\\n(cid:122) Citing lessons learned while referring to journal entries.\\n(cid:122) Providing time for a leader to reflect and write down personal lessons learned.\\n(cid:122) Providing leaders with a journal and a personal note encouraging them to use it.\\n(cid:122) Asking leaders to write or recount a story of a key leader challenge and use the stories to pass on\\nlessons learned to less experienced leaders.\\n3-75. Cooperative methods of online journaling, sharing online blogs, or cooperating in message boards can\\nhelp source novel ideas and solutions from a community of like-minded individuals that a leader might not\\nnormally interact with on a daily basis. Sharing ideas, questions, and solutions in an online forum, social\\nmedia platform, message board, or professional blog enables a wider audience to interact and share thoughts,\\noffering an external viewpoint or insight. The same reflective journaling questions still apply, but this enables\\na much more visible and accessible presence to reinforce the importance of reflective journaling.\\nLEARNING IN ACTION\\n3-76. Self-development takes time and effort. Putting a plan into action requires patience and resilience.\\nAnticipating and accepting setbacks as part of the process requires commitment. Acknowledging and\\naccepting that self-development efforts must balance against organization requirements and family\\nobligations is crucial. Having the support of peers, leaders, subordinates, family, and friends throughout a\\ncareer-long self-development effort can provide motivation through lulls in achieving milestones and goals.\\nTo stay on track\u2014\\n(cid:122) Let milestones serve as a guide.\\n(cid:122) Overcome self-development obstacles.\\n(cid:122) Work efficiently.\\n(cid:122) Maintain forward momentum.\\n(cid:122) Assess progress.\\n(cid:122) Make course corrections.\\n(cid:122) Set the next milestone.\\nLETMILESTONES GUIDE\\n3-77. Use the milestones technique previously discussed and developed in this chapter as a guide to\u2014\\n(cid:122) Avoid impulsive actions that may be ineffective and discouraging.\\n(cid:122) Keep the big picture in mind.\\n(cid:122) Work effectively toward self-development goals.\\n(cid:122) Take advantage of resources and overcome obstacles.\\n(cid:122) Measure success.\\n3-78. Adjust the plan as needed to reach milestones. Be willing to update the plan to improve it, change\\ngoals, address obstacles, take advantage of resources, and reflect upon accomplishments.\\nOVERCOME SELF-DEVELOPMENT OBSTACLES\\n3-79. In developing a milestone plan, you identified obstacles to reaching the first milestone. The possibility\\nof encountering internal and external obstacles, despite thorough preparation, is always present.\\nInternal Obstacles\\n3-80. Procrastination, apathy, and pride are major obstacles to self-development and occur for many reasons.\\nSome come to realize their milestones are too ambitious, complex, unclear, or difficult. Others hesitate\\nbecause of the effort or discomfort the work requires or lack the motivation to start. It is easy in such situations\\nto allow other work priorities to distract developmental efforts. Table 3-4on page 3-22 provides techniques\\nto address procrastination.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-21Chapter 3\\nTable 3-4.

Recognize what you do to avoid things you do not want to do.\\nKnow Confront yourself when you do these things.\\nyourself Identify self-defeating attitudes and replace them with positive ones.\\nIf you repeatedly delay a task, do you really intend to do it? If not, remove it from the plan.\\nBe open to\\nIf an area is overly complex or uninteresting, consider an adjustment for a higher potential path.\\ndeviations\\n3-81. Poor attitudes interfere with learning and impede understanding and remembering information. For\\nexample, thinking math is hard or disliking history can interfere with learning anything related to math or\\nhistory. Other attitudes, such as closed mindedness, inflexibility, or rigid adherence to beliefs and\\nassumptions, can interfere with learning. To combat poor attitudes, identify a productive replacement.\\nPractice thinking and behaving with a positive attitude until it feels natural and becomes a habit.\\n3-82. A lack of knowledge may be a major obstacle in reaching milestones. Being unaware of the resources,\\nprocesses, and best practices of others who have worked toward similar goals may hinder progress. Involving\\nothers may provide the necessary information and motivation to making progress.\\nExternal Obstacles\\n3-83. External factors such as workload or other personal or professional obligations may affect self-\\ndevelopment efforts. Seeking support from family and friends enables their involvement and awareness of\\nyour milestones and goals and allows them to provide help and support.\\n3-84. Lacking resources is another common roadblock. Resources include anything needed for self-\\ndevelopment including people (such as teachers, coaches, or mentors), facilities (such as schools, libraries,\\nor museums), and things (such as training programs, books, and equipment). Learners best handle external\\nobstacles through careful planning and creativity.\\nWORKEFFICIENTLY\\n3-85. By efficiently managing workload and personal life, one can increase how much time is available to\\nspend on self-development. To increase efficiency\u2014\\n(cid:122) Take care of yourself. Proper food, exercise, and rest enable you to function at your best.\\n(cid:122) Manage time and energy efficiently. Keep a running \u2018to do\u2019 list. Prioritize each task according to\\nits importance, required work, and completion date. Remove low-priority tasks from the list.\\n(cid:122) Look for ways to accomplish daily activities and routines in less time. For example, combine\\nseveral errands in a single trip instead of making individual trips.\\n(cid:122) Learn to quickly locate and obtain the information needed for self-development and other daily\\nlife requirements.\\n3-22 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n(cid:122) Organize work and living areas so that required information, tools, and workspace are available.\\nMAINTAIN FORWARD MOMENTUM\\n3-86. It is important to keep the developmental momentum moving forward. There may be a tendency to\\nslow down after completing an important self-development step or be discouraged by setbacks. Resting after\\na strong effort is natural, but too much rest may make it hard to restart. Maintain momentum by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Keeping a positive attitude: Let setbacks go and start each day with renewed enthusiasm. Each\\nmorning offers an opportunity for a fresh start.\\n(cid:122) Making consistent progress: Accomplish something, however small, related to self-development\\nmilestones and goals each day.\\n(cid:122) Recognizing benefits: Benefits are tangible results such as increased pay, awards, and abilities or\\nintangible results such as pride, a sense of accomplishment, and satisfaction. Remember that\\nimportant benefits often require hard work.\\nASSESS PROGRESS\\n3-87. Assessing progress can provide encouragement to keep going if things are going well or to guide\\nchanges if they are not. Individuals can assess progress at any time\u2014while working toward a milestone or\\nafter completing one. To assess progress\u2014\\n(cid:122) Use objective and subjective measures.\\n(cid:122) Objective measures can be seen or expressed in numbers, such as test scores, time required to\\nperform tasks, number of books read, or college credits earned.\\n(cid:122) Subjective measures cannot be easily observed or expressed in numbers, including feelings of\\nsatisfaction, accomplishment, personal growth, or difficulty. Subjective progress assessments can\\ncome from personal judgment and feedback. Subjective indicators are often sufficient to track\\nmost self-development activities.\\n(cid:122) Compare the milestone plan with what happened and adjust the remainder of this milestone plan\\nor future milestones to account for lessons learned.\\n(cid:122) Timeline: Was the timeline met? If well under or over the timeline, determine why. Maybe the\\ntimeline was not reasonable, more or less work was anticipated, received extra help, encountered\\nobstacles, or the material was more involved thaninitially thought.\\n(cid:122) Action Steps: How successful were you in accomplishing the steps identified for reaching the\\nmilestone? What helped or hurt success? Were the identified steps the right ones?\\n(cid:122) Resources: Were required resources to achieve the milestone correctly identified? Did the plan\\nomit any resources? Were necessary resources available? Are there any other resources that might\\nhave worked better?\\n(cid:122) Obstacles: Were identified obstacles encountered? Was the plan to overcome these obstacles\\nsuccessful? Were unexpected obstacles encountered?\\n(cid:122) Decide if you are satisfied with your progress or if the milestones or self-development goals need\\nchanges. Indicators to consider in making a course correction include:\\n(cid:122) Unsatisfactory progress.\\n(cid:122) Too much stress or effort required to complete developmental activities.\\n(cid:122) Loss of interest in achieving self-development aims or change in the benefits expected from\\nachieving those aims.\\n(cid:122) Changes in professional or personal situations that conflict with self-development activities.\\n(cid:122) Being dissatisfied with personal development.\\nMAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS\\n3-88. Self-development occurs over time in a dynamic environment that includes professional and personal\\nresponsibilities. At some point, obstacles or other challenges force a change of plans. If the progress\\nassessment indicates course corrections are needed, determine what correction is warranted:\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-23Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Goal: A self-development goal or milestone may have been too difficult, too easy, or just not what\\nwas hoped. Examine other possible self-development goals or milestones. Identify why you\\nselected the unsatisfactory goal or milestone. Avoid repeating any missteps.\\n(cid:122) Action Steps: If the actions taken to achieve milestones were ineffective, figure out why and\\ndevelop effective actions.

This chapter provides a deliberate and logical framework to support Army leaders developing\\nthemselves and others. These activities follow the same organization as the leader attributes and competencies\\nfound in the Army leadership requirements model (see ADP 6-22), to help individuals identify and prioritize\\nwhich leader requirements to target for growth. The developmental activity tables follow a standard format:\\nstrength and need indicators, underlying causes, and recommended options to initiate action. The indicators\\nprovide ways to understand leader actions and confirm aspects of each leader behavior as a strength or a\\ndevelopmental need. The underlying causes provide more information on what the root cause may be for a\\ndevelopmental need. The tables provide three options for developmental action: feedback, study, and practice\\n4-2. To best use this chapter\u2019s information, one identifies the competency and attribute behaviors for\\ndevelopmental focus. An individual may already have an IDP that documents goals and a plan for\\ndevelopment or have an idea of what leadership competency or skill to develop. A coach, rater, counselor, or\\nmentor can use this material to help focus leaders or subordinates on specific developmental goals and\\nprepare for growth counseling. Different sources and events inform the process to identify developmental\\ngoals for competencies and behaviors as illustrated in table 4-1.\\nTable 4-1.

While these may be helpful, leaders are encouraged to\\nselect developmental activities that fit with personal preferences and situation.

After identifying a developmental focus, refer to the Army leadership requirements model and the\\nleader developmental tables to evaluate the leader capabilities associated with the selected competency or\\nattribute. Each section is designed to help a leader act on strengths as well as developmental needs. Some\\nmay experience greater growth by focusing on improving strengths rather than focusing on developmental\\nneeds or using strengths to address developmental needs.\\nCAPABILITY EVALUATION\u2014STRENGTH AND NEED INDICATORS ANDUNDERLYING CAUSES\\n4-4. Evaluating capabilities involves identifying personal practices that support or hinder successful\\nperformance. Each table includes diagnostics to enable evaluating how well someone is doing on that\\nbehavior and provides examples of why they may or may not be excelling. Consider if the strength and need\\nindicators represent personal behaviors. Be aware of counterproductive leadership behaviors. Many leaders\\nare aware of such behaviors but choose to overlook or condone them to achieve short-term results, but\\noftentimes some leaders may not even realize they display such behaviors. Each diagnostic section includes:\\n(cid:122) Strength Indicators: Behaviors and actions that contribute to or support successful performance.\\n(cid:122) Need Indicators: Behaviors and actions that reduce or hinder successful performance.\\n(cid:122) Underlying Causes: Examples why someone may not excel at a particular leader behavior.\\nCAPABILITY GROWTH\u2014FEEDBACK,STUDY,ANDPRACTICE\\n4-5.

View all suggestions for developmental activities througha personal lens. The following questions are\\nsample questions to ask when refining a development activity to fit personal needs and situation. Depending\\non the chosen activity, other considerations may be important too. Be willing to take risks and choose\\nactivities outside personal comfort zones to challenge yourself and accelerate development.\\nDetermining Developmental Activities\\nAnswer these to select appropriate developmental activities:\\nDevelopmental Activity: How do I need to improve?\\nDesired Outcome: What do I hope to achieve?\\nMethod: How am I going to do this? What resources do I need?\\nTime available: When will I do this? How will I monitor progress (such as identifying\\nand monitoring milestones, rewarding success, or identifying accountability partners)?\\nLimits: What factors will affect or hinder successfully implementing this activity?\\nControls: What minimizes or controls the factors that hinder implementing this\\nactivity?\\n4-8. Use tables 4-4 and 4-5 (starting on page 4-4) to locate appropriate developmental activities. Leader\\n180 and Leader 360 feedback reports detail individual or unit strengths and developmental needs. Learners\\nand coaches select a few actions at a time to guide development. Additionally, these reports inform leaders\\nof any counterproductive leadership behaviors others have observed in them.\\n4-9.

Neither could answer\\nthe question.\\nLTC Day: \u201cGentlemen, your plan is sound, and the outcome will be trained teams ready\\nto move into greater collective training, but we are missing an opportunity to develop\\nour leaders here. Training without thought of the LRM is like an unguided missile, it\\ngets the job done, but we owe it to our subordinate leaders to be precise. Don\u2019t let\\nleader development just happen, be deliberate and actively plan for it.\u201d\\nCPT Kenny and 1SG Mac return to their office to discuss what LTC Day said.\\nCPT Kenny: \u201cI understand what LTC Day said, and I know our leaders need some\\nwork. We have both worked with them on their IDPs. Several things almost derailed\\nour individual training leading up to this, mostly centered on communication. What\\nshould we do to focus on that?\u201d\\n1SG Mac: \u201cWe wanted to get better tactically, but maybe we should have been more\\nspecific. We know what we want to improve, we just didn\u2019t select competencies to work\\non. Perhaps we can alter our training scenarios to deliberately target communication\\nbetween leaders.\u201d\\nAfter NTC, the OC/T, CPT Smole, is conducting the final AAR with the company.\\nCPT Smole: \u201cLet me begin by saying that it was truly a pleasure to watch this company\\noperate during this rotation.

Nor would I\\nhave thought that it would work. Once we figured it out though, we incorporated it into\\neverything we did and every leader could always tell me what the training objective,\\nand developmental objective, for every event was. I had no greater pleasure as a\\ncompany commander than deliberately developing my subordinates and watching\\nthem progress into great leaders in their own right.\\n~from the diary of CPT Kenny (former company commander)\\nARMY VALUES\\n4-10.

Empathy is defined as the ability to share and understand someone else\u2019s feelings. The capacity for\\nempathy is an important attribute for leaders to possess. Empathy can allow leaders to understand how their\\nactions affect others. The ability to see something from another person\u2019s viewpoint, to identify with, and\\nenter into another person\u2019s feelings and emotions, enables the Army leader to better interact with others.\\n4-16. Army leaders show empathy when they genuinely relate to another person\u2019s situation, motives, and\\nfeelings. Empathy does not necessarily mean sympathy, but identification leading to a deeper understanding.\\nEmpathy allows the leader to anticipate what others are experiencing and envision how decisions or actions\\naffect others.\\n4-17. Leaders with a capacity for empathy can apply it to understanding and anticipating the reactions of DA\\nCivilians, Soldiers and their Families, and local populations. Empathy helps a leader take care of Soldiers\\nand others and demonstrate respect. Army leaders take care of Soldiers and DA Civilians by giving them the\\ntraining, equipment and support needed to accomplish the mission. They value balance between mission\\nrequirements and the welfare of their followers. It improves morale, climate, decision-making, and readiness.\\nThe attribute empathy has one component: Identify with another person\u2019s feelings and emotions.\\n4-18. Army leaders must be able to understand different personal value systems and that these values directly\\ninfluence how others feel about various circumstances, situations, and decisions. Being able to put oneself in\\nanother\u2019s situation to identify with their feelings is important to develop a full understanding of others to\\nmake better decisions and adapt interactions with others (see table 4-9 on page 4-9).\\n4-8 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Learning and Developmental Activities\\nTable 4-9.

The Warrior Ethos refers to the professional attitudes and beliefs that characterize the American\\nSoldier. It reflects a Soldier\u2019s selfless commitment to the Nation, mission, unit, and fellow Soldiers.

Discipline is a mindset for a unit or an organization to practice sustained, systematic actions to reach\\nand promote a capability to perform its military function. Often this involves attending to organization and\\nadministration details, which are less urgent than an organization\\'s key tasks, but necessary for efficiency\\nand long-term effectiveness. Making the right choices involves discipline. Discipline is a reinforcing function\\nto character. Self-discipline is everyone\u2019s responsibility, while leaders also are responsible for unit discipline.\\nDevelopment relies on self-discipline to put others\u2019 needs ahead of personal comfort and desires.

The attribute humility has one component: Seek\\nfeedback and explore personal performance (see table 4-12).\\n4-24. Humility exists on a continuum. Effective leaders exhibit an appropriate degree of humility. Others\\nview a leader who expresses excess humility as being meek, timid, or overly passive. Conversely, others\\nconsider a leader who expresses too little humility as overconfident or arrogant. A leader lacking self-\\nconfidence may feel the need to hide any perception of weakness and may display arrogant behavior as a\\nresult while a self-confident individual is free to demonstrate humility. A leader who expresses too much or\\ntoo little humility lacks self-awareness. This, in turn undermines confidence in the leader\u2019s ability to make\\ngood decisions and achieve success.\\nTable 4-12.

Efforts to develop leaders yield better results if the focus is on proven methods. Army leadership\\nrequires establishing interpersonal relationships based on trust and setting the example for subordinates,\\npeers, and superiors. In leader development surveys, leaders ranked leading a unit, personal examples, and\\nmentoring as the three most effective ways to develop their leadership qualities. Integrating leader\\ndevelopmentfundamentalsinto an organization creates a positive, learning climate and builds a mindset that\\nprioritizes development. Experience is a powerful learning tool, although it does not guarantee learning. As\\nthe leader development tenets convey, learning requires commitment and purpose.\\n5-2. Leader development benefits both individuals and the organization. The Army is known for its success\\nin developing leaders rapidly. Many development opportunities occur in organizations, though not always\\nused for their learning value. Without intent or a program for leader development, organizational emphasis\\non learning follows commander interest and unit climate. Leader development programs leverage\\nopportunities to address individual and organizational goals for development.\\n5-3. Commanders are responsible for training and leader development in their units and for providing a\\nculture in which learning takes place. They must deliberately plan, prepare, execute, and assess training and\\ndevelopment as part of their overall operations. Commanders and leaders must integrate leader development\\ninto their organizational training plans.\\n5-4. Developing Army leaders at all levels, military and civilian, is the best means to ensure the Army\\nadapts to future uncertainties. In this sense, leader development directly relates to Army readiness.\\nIndividuals who feel the Army and their leaders are interested in them are motivated to demonstrate greater\\ninitiative and to engage fully in leader development. Development programs that integrate professional and\\npersonal goals are the most effective. Program content needs to account for the individual\u2019s competence,\\ncharacter, and commitment to develop the attributes and competencies desired of Army leaders.\\n5-5. Organizational leader development programs must nest in purpose and guidance with the higher\\norganization\u2019s program. Programs should be consistent with Army enterprise concepts, strategy, and\\nguidance on leader development. Programs should provide guidance to subordinate units yet allow freedom\\nto determine practices and schedules most conducive to their missions. Programs up and down an\\norganizational structure need to align to create synergy and unity of effort. A battalion or equivalent-sized\\nleader development program should identify specific processes supporting development. Generating force\\norganizations headed by a colonel or similar ranking DA Civilian are a good target for programs that detail\\nspecific processes. A battalion program should anticipate the needs of and execution by its subordinate units.\\n5-6. Variations in programs occur across echelons depending on the organization type and size. For\\nexample, a division has greater latitude in selecting leaders for special assignments than does a battalion due\\nto the wider scope of opportunities and larger number of leaders. A Reserve Component unit has fewer\\ntraining days to plan and schedule team building events, so there may be a greater role for self-development\\nand mentoring. Detached and dispersed units have fewer organic assets to prepare and conduct special events\\nbut may have access to external opportunities, such as a training detachment on a university campus.\\n5-7. The Army holds commanders accountable for unit leader development by regulation (see AR 350-1).\\nAccountability can be included as part of the organizational inspection program (see AR 1-201).\\nResponsibility for leader development cuts across all leader and staff roles.

How are the 1SGs doing?\u201d\\nCSM Undeu: \u201cThey\u2019re running a little ragged from the training timeline but are holding\\nup.\u201d\\nCSM Sash: \u201cHow are you incorporating developmental opportunities for your 1SGs\\nduring this event? Remember, even though they are not the target for this event, we\\ncan still challenge and develop them. The systems they use to track their platoons\\nshouldn\u2019t be different from what they will use in combat. The brigade needs your help\\nin identifying developmental strengths and needs at the 1SG/commander level to\\nensure that we are seeing ourselves accurately. Find a way to assess your command\\nteams during events like this, otherwise you\u2019ll miss things that are critical to the\\nbrigade\u2019s success.\u201d\\nCSM Undeu: \u201cI take your point. I got too focused on the platoons since this event\\ncenters on them. I completely missed how observations, assessments, and feedback\\non the next level up reinforces brigade training and leader development objectives.\u201d\\nCSM Sash: \u201cThe focus should be at the platoon-level, and you are doing that well. It is\\nalso important to take this opportunity to help the brigade see itself since gaps you\\nmight find may extend across the rest of the brigade. It helps the brigade commander\\nand me confirm or deny what we think are individual and collective developmental\\nneeds at the company level.\u201d\\n5-8. The next-higher echelon commander, human resources and operations staff, and senior cohort leaders\\nmust clarify development roles and responsibilities. These individuals directly and indirectly affect the\\nefficiency and effectiveness of leader development.\\nDelineating Responsibilities\\nEfficiently implementing leader development programs depends on clearly defining\\nand allocating responsibilities across leaders and staff both in and outside the\\norganization. Develop a matrix to document notes on theroles and responsibilities for\\ndeveloping leaders in the organization.\\nUNIT LEADER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\\n5-9. Leader development is a mindset and process, not merely an event, reflected by everything leaders do.\\nAn opportunity for development exists in every event, class, assignment, duty position, discussion, physical\\ntraining formation, briefing, and engagement. Leader development is a continual and purposeful process. It\\nis an ongoing process intended to achieve incremental and progressive results over time.\\n5-2 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Program Development\\nPROGRAM CREATION\\n5-10. Various types and echelons of commands and organizations label their leader development guidance\\nwith different descriptions such as strategy, philosophy, policy, memorandum, plan, or standing procedure.\\nThe title and format are less important than having a good plan\u2014one that aligns with the leader development\\ntenets: committed organization; clear purpose; supportive learning culture; enabler of education, training,\\nand experience; and feedback. The plan helps to inspire and guide the organization to engage in development.\\nPrograms that incorporate leader development into daily operations without creating extra events are well\\nreceived and have the greatest chance for effective implementation. Having a plan brings attention to leader\\ndevelopment, provides focus and purpose, encourages the mindset, sets conditions, shows how development\\nshould occur, and coordinates efforts across the organization.\\n5-11. Developing a leader development program follows the same steps used in the operations process (see\\nADP 5-0). Planning involves understanding a situation, envisioning a desired future, and planning effective\\nways to achieve that future. The program should allow for disciplined initiative by subordinate units and\\nindividual leaders. A leader development program is specific because the outcomes need to address both\\norganizational and individual goals as well as short-term and long-term goals. The long-term focus extends\\nbeyond a commander\u2019s tour and beyond the member\u2019s time in the unit. Most DA Civilian leaders are not\\nreassigned based on time, though leader development programs like those in operational units often serve\\ntheir needs. Once the commander\u2019s visualization is described and the program plan is developed, they direct\\npreparing and executing the unit\u2019s leader development program. The commander and unit leaders execute\\nthe program and assess its progress. The leader development program creates change in the organization and\\nin individuals\u2014it is a living document. As leaders develop, update the program plan.\\nUnderstand\\n5-12. To aid understanding, leader teams can use formal assessments such as command climate surveys,\\naggregated trends from leader assessments, unit-level assessments (such as Unit 360 or Army Readiness\\nAssessment Program), training center AAR take-home packages, and command inspection program results\\nto focus on conditions indicating unit strengths and developmental needs. Even an analysis of all unit\\nmembers\u2019 IDPs can provide detail on where to focus or where developmental gaps may exist. The leader\\nteam takes these various information sources along with their own observations and discussions with\\nsubordinates and colleagues to determine an appropriate focus. Table 5-1 lists external and internal\\ninformation sources leaders can use to shape and inform an assessment of their organization.\\nTable 5-1.

The battalion struggles with last-minute maintenance and\\nsupply issues which causes a lot of unpredictability for its Soldiers.\\nCSM Baker: \u201cYou all were in the training meeting last week.

Those engagements can be a developmental opportunity for them. This can\\nfree up some of our senior leaders to focus on implementing the commander\u2019s\\nguidance. Provide feedback to those you delegate responsibility to.\u201d\\n1SG Morton: \u201cAcknowledge all sergeant major. We\u2019ll continue to use these\\nopportunities to develop our leaders. I have several corporals and specialists that could\\nhandle some of the things I would usually task a sergeant with.\u201d\\nCSM Baker: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I will work at the battalion level to protect your time, but you\\nare responsible for using it. Don\u2019t let your commanders plan in a vacuum, be involved\\nand proactive in developing your people. Look for innovative ways to incorporate\\nleader development and communicate with your leaders. Let them know you are\\ndeliberately developing them and everything they do is a developmental opportunity\u2014\\ntake advantage of it\u2014and grow as a Soldier and leader.\u201d\\nVisualize\\n5-14. Several sources inform decisions about setting the desired future end states for leader development.\\nPhilosophically, the team can examine the Army Campaign Plan and the intent in higher and sister\\norganization\u2019s development programs. The most important and enduring outcomes are stated in a vision or\\nintent statement, depending on the commander\u2019spreference.\\n5-15. An organizational development program establishes the goals for specific end states. Each leader\\ndevelopment program has four mutually supporting purposes. Each organization leader has a designated\\nresponsibility to accomplish the mission, improve the organization, prepare personnel to perform current\\nduties, and develop leaders for future responsibilities and other assignments. Different from unit training\\nplans, the leader development programaddresses long-term outcomes for individuals and the organization.\\n5-16. Outcomes should address at least these four areas (see table 5-2). Planning and executing the leader\\ndevelopment program is an organizational leader\u2019s responsibility. The vision or intent helps to focus and\\nsynchronize leader development actions across the organization to achieve the greatest effects.\\nTable 5-2.

He already said we can fight one rank up for taskings and that should help\\nfree up some leaders.\u201d\\nSFC Jefferies: \u201cThat will help a little but that doesn\u2019t solve the issue of the platoons\\nbeing ready for collective training. They just need more time together, and we don\u2019t\\nhave that.\u201d\\n1SG Diaz: \u201cWhat if we stopped pulling from across the company for taskings and\\ninstead put whole teams on them together? This would give team building time without\\nadding anything to the calendar.

From considering the learning enablers and developmental opportunities,the leader team creates a plan\\nfor scheduling events. The schedule assists those leading and supporting the execution. The schedule\\nmaintains reasonable activities and direction of emphasis to help ensure quality. Some events are required,\\nsuch as performance evaluations and professional growth counseling, and the plan\u2019s emphasis triggers other\\nactivities. The plan shouldencourage a mindset where leaders take the initiative to incorporate development\\ninto daily activities. Such activities include raising questions in an AAR about what leaders learned about\\nleadership or asking leaders what self-development they are doing.\\n5-21. The leader decides the best method to describe the leader development program, such as annual\\nconcept, quarterly concept with specific events, or theme based. The plan needs synchronize with the overall\\nunit schedule considering the training calendar, significant higher headquarters\u2019events that need support,and\\nother significant events.\\nExecute\\n5-22. Once completed, the leaders distribute the plan throughout the unit to direct program preparation and\\nexecution.Depending on the echelon, the leaders review subordinate unit leader developmentprograms.The\\nleader team sets, directs, and leads the organizational goals, shaping the conditions for individual\\ndevelopment. Individual development is based on the interests and the effort of individuals who develop\\nothers and themselves. It is up to each individual to learn, grow, and develop as an Army professional. An\\nIDP is a personal development plan. It is important that individuals and their raters work together to develop\\nan IDP. Executing the leader development program can become a regularly reported item in reviews, situation\\nreports, and training briefs.\\n5-23. Leaders must ensure the plan affects development positively. The plan is a way to emphasize\\ndevelopment and desired outcomes for individuals and for units. Leaders develop the plan with an intent to\\nsee it through. Reviewed, assessed, and updated periodically, the plan is a living document. Leaders commit\\nto creating an open learning environment where development becomes second nature, like when leaders\\nintegrate leader development into daily administrative and training events, as well as deployments.\\nAssess\\n5-24. Good units use various and distinct methods to continually assess leader and leader development\\nstrength and weaknesses.The leader team needs to ensure individual development stays the main effort and\\nthat the focus does not become the plan or running events. The documented plan is either an enabler or a\\ndetractor to successfully executing and achieving the desired outcomes depending on the degree of initiative.\\n5-25. Leaders assess implementation and execution against the established vision and end states. Just as\\nleadership assessments help set goals for the unit leader development program, assessing the program\\nimplementation and execution providesuseful information on how well the end states are being achieved and\\nareas for adjustment. The leader team should monitor whether the vision and end states areadequate or need\\nimprovement (see Section IV in chapter 2).\\n5-26. Leaders must conduct required development activitiessuch as performance evaluations, professional\\ngrowth counseling, IDPs, and command climate surveys. A leader\u2019s assessment in developing others can\\noccur through reviewing how leaders used formal, semi-formal, and informal activities in the program. The\\nleadership requirements model establishes the expectations for these functions and performance evaluations\\nhave provided the mechanism for checking. Multi-source assessments provide personal feedback to the leader\\non what they have done to establish a positive climate, engage in developing others, and steward the\\nprofession. The multi-source feedback provides an opportunity for leaders to address and improve their\\napproaches before evaluation.\\n5-27. Leader development is a holistic process that occurs every day aligning training, education, and\\nexperience to prepare leaders to improve. Development is critical to all cohorts\u2014enlisted, officer, and\\ncivilian\u2014the Army\u2019s future leaders source.

Some options include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Professional reading programs.\\n(cid:122) Professional writing programs.\\n(cid:122) Staff rides, historical tours, and terrain walks.\\nProfessional Reading Programs\\n5-29. Organizations and individuals can implement professional reading programs; many materials are\\navailable to supporttopic determination, such as the U.S. Army Chief of Staff\u2019s Professional Reading list or\\nthe U.S. Army Center of Military History Recommended Professional Reading List. Reading\\nrecommendations and book reviews from military journals, online discussion forums, podcasts, and social\\nmedia provide options for inclusion into unit or personal reading programs.Determining the frequency, such\\nas monthly or quarterly, depends on organizational missions, but the unit must allocate and protect time for\\neffective implementation. Professional reading programs can include a mix of journal articles, professional\\npapers, graphic novels, or military professional blog posts. Mixing sources enables leaders to share new ideas,\\nwriting styles, and emerging authors.\\nSuccessful reading programs depend on how they are structured\u2014what readings are chosen and\\nwhat purpose is integrated into the program. To encourage tactics, then select readings on\\noperational tactics. To develop skills for which interesting readings do not exist, then design\\nquestions that trigger reflection about engaging material. For example, to stimulate critical\\nthinking assign questions about the materials that require applying lessons to other situations and\\nconsidering underlying assumptions and alternative courses of action.\\nProfessional Writing Programs\\n5-30. Army leaders consider how they can contribute to the body of thought in their fields of expertise by\\nresearching and writing about topics that interest them. By writing and publishing papers, they can advance\\ntheir profession, mastery of their discipline, and writing skills. Scholarly paper writers study their topics in\\ndepth and in breadth. They take formal classes in research and in writing so they can master appropriate\\nstandards. They use appropriate writing processes. Before submitting papers to professional or academic\\njournals, they ensure their submissions meet the publications\u2019 requirements. In addition, the unit security\\noffice should screen items for publication to prevent classified information spillage. Writers scrupulously\\nadhere to intellectual property rights rules and shun plagiarism.\\n5-31. For leaders, a developmental writing program serves as a significant complementary companion to a\\nprofessional reading program and may lead to publication in scholarly journals. Length may vary based on\\nthe requirement. Some ideas for professional writing include:\\n(cid:122) Leadership philosophy\u2014an opportunity to discuss expectations, what is important, and what is\\nnon-negotiable.\\n(cid:122) Personal experiences:\\n(cid:131) Significant experience, whether good or bad, and its personal effect including lessons learned.\\n(cid:131) Routine experiences, describing how you handle them and possible improvements for\\nconsideration.\\n(cid:122) Historical person or event related to the branch, regimental affiliation, or organization.\\n(cid:122) Opinion piece explaining changes affecting your branch through a particular person, policy, or\\nequipment.\\n(cid:122) Book or movie reviews providing a detailed analysis of published or broadcast material for an\\nonline or professional journal.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 5-9Chapter 5\\nConsiderations for Professional Reading\\nReading programs foster study by making the reading relevant, providing a purpose,\\nand following up.

A staff ride is a historical campaign or battle study that usually includes deep preliminary study, an\\nextensive site visit, and opportunities to dissect and integrate lessons learned throughout the event. A\\ncomponent of this detailed study is a terrain analysis and the terrain\u2019s effect upon the battle or campaign.\\nSeeing the location provides context to leader decisions and insight into the choices leaders made.\\n5-33. Staff ride handbooks and atlases enable organizations to conduct staff rides, often with assistance from\\nthe Army University Pressor Center for Military History. Occasionally, units develop their own staff rides\\nand share products with other organizations. Virtual staff ridesfollow the same methodology as a live staff\\nride but provide a detailed terrain replication based upon satellite imagery, digital terrain, or three-\\ndimensional models to immerse participants in the virtual terrain and provide a realistic battlefield vision.\\n5-34. Historical battlefield tours or museum visits can provide opportunities to visualize leadership and\\nhistorical lessons by interacting with material items or physical terrain, but without the detailed study\\nassociated with a staff ride. Battlefield tours are typically brief and may include facilitated instruction from\\n5-10 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Program Development\\na guide.

Developing a set of formal and informal indicators that accurately assess the health of unit leader\\ndevelopment in the organization is essential. Leaders use locally developed indicators to develop a leader\\ndevelopment scorecard (see figure 5-6). Indicators may be different for different unit types, such as\\noperational vice institutional. Employing a red/amber/green status suggests indicators requiring further\\ninvestigation, which may or may not relate directly to unit leader development efforts. The purpose is to\\nidentify trends over time and not react adversely to an indicator\u2019s single occurrence.\\nAdd locally developed leader development indicators to the unit training brief for subordinate\\nunits to track and report on like other key unit systems (such as training, maintenance, or budget).\\nRefine the measures to those that accurately indicate leader development health.\\nFigure 5-6.

(Ceremonies\\nare formations\u2014the arrangement of elements of a unit in a prescribed manner\u2014and movements in\\nwhich a number of troops execute movements in unison and with precision just as in drill; however,\\ntheir primary value is to render honors, preserve traditions, and stimulate esprit de corps.) It includes\\nmethods of instructing drill (movements by which a unit or individuals are moved in a uniform manner\\nfrom one formation to another, or from one place to another, with movements executed in unison and\\nwith precision), teaching techniques, individual and unit drill, manual of arms for Infantry weapons, and\\nvarious other aspects of basic drill instruction.\\nThe principal audience for TC 3-21.5 is all members of the profession of arms. Commanders\u2014the Soldiers\\nin charge\u2014and staffs of Army headquarters serving as joint task force or multinational headquarters should\\nalso refer to applicable joint or multinational doctrine concerning the range of military operations and joint\\nor multinational forces. Trainers and educators throughout the Army will also use this publication. Since all\\nsituations or eventualities pertaining to drill and ceremonies cannot be foreseen, commanders may find it\\nnecessary to adjust the procedures to local conditions. However, with the view toward maintaining\\nconsistency throughout the Army, the procedures prescribed herein should be followed as closely as possible.\\nPersonnel preparing to give drill instruction must be thoroughly familiar with chapters 3 through 7 before\\nattempting to teach material in chapters 8 and 9.\\nFor ease in distinguishing a preparatory command from a command of execution, the commands of execution\\nappear in BOLD CAP letters and preparatory commands appear in Bold Italic letters.

If anyone of you doesn\u2019t mean\\nbusiness let him say so now. An hour from now will be too late to back out. Once in,\\nyou\u2019ve got to see it through. You\u2019ve got to perform without flinching whatever duty is\\nassigned you, regardless of the difficulty or the danger attending it. If it is garrison duty,\\nyou must attend to it. If it is meeting fever, you must be willing. If it is the closest kind\\nof fighting, anxious for it. You must know how to ride, how to shoot, how to live in the\\nopen. Absolute obedience to every command is your first lesson. No matter what\\ncomes you mustn\u2019t squeal. Think it over\u2014all of you. If man wishes to withdraw he will\\nbe gladly excused, for others are ready to take his place.\u201d\\nTheodore Roosevelt, Remarks to Recruits, 1898\\nChapter 1\\nIntroduction\\nThe purpose of drill is to enable commanders or noncommissioned officers (NCOs) to\\nmove their unit from one place to another in an orderly manner, to aid in disciplinary\\ntraining by instilling habits of precision and response to the leader\u2019s orders, and to\\nprovide for the development of all Soldiers in the practice of commanding troops.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n1-1. Military history reveals that armies throughout the world participated in some form of drill. The\\nprimary value of drill, historically, is to prepare troops for battle. For the most part, the drill procedures\\npracticed are identical to the tactical maneuvers employed on the battlefield. Drill enables commanders to\\nquickly move their forces from one point to another, mass their forces into a battle formation that affords\\nmaximum firepower, and maneuver those forces as the situation develops.\\n1-2. In 1775, when this country was striving for independence and existence, the Nation\u2019s leaders were\\nconfronted with the problem of not only establishing a government but also of organizing an Army that was\\nalready engaged in war. From the \u201cshot heard around the world,\u201d on 19 April 1775, until Valley Forge in\\n1778, Revolutionary forces were little more than a group of civilians fighting Indian-style against\\nwell-trained, highly disciplined British Redcoats. For three years, General George Washington\u2019s troops had\\nendured many hardships\u2014lack of funds, rations, clothing, and equipment. They had also suffered numerous\\nlosses to the superior British forces. These hardships and losses mostly stemmed from the lack of a military\\natmosphere in the country, resulting in the creation of an Army with little or no organization, control,\\ndiscipline, or teamwork.\\n1-3. Recognizing the crisis, General Washington, through Benjamin Franklin, the American ambassador to\\nFrance, enlisted the aid of Prussian officer Baron Friedrich von Steuben. Upon his arrival at Valley Forge on\\n23 February 1778, von Steuben, a former staff officer for Frederick the Great, met an army of several\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 1-1Chapter 1\\nthousand wretched, half-starved men in rags. He commented that a European army could not be kept together\\nin such a state. To correct the conditions that prevailed, he set to work immediately and wrote drill movements\\nand regulations at night and taught them the following day to a model company of 120 men selected from\\nthe line.\\n1-4. Discipline became a part of military life for these selected individuals as they learned to respond to\\ncommand without hesitation. This new discipline instilled in them a sense of alertness, urgency, and attention\\nto detail. Their confidence in themselves and their weapon grew as each Soldier perfected the fifteen 1-second\\nmovements required to load and fire their musket. As the Americans mastered the art of drill, they began to\\nwork as a team and to develop pride in themselves and in their units.\\n1-5. Watching this model company drill, observers were amazed to see how quickly and orderly the troops\\ncould be massed and maneuvered into different battle formations. Officers observed that organization, chain\\nof command, and control were improved as each Soldier had a specific place and task within the formation.\\nLater, the members of the model company were distributed throughout the Army to teach drill. Through drill,\\nthey improved the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Army.\\n1-6. To ensure continuity and uniformity, von Steuben, by then a major general and the Army Inspector\\nGeneral, wrote the first Army field manual in 1779, \u201cThe Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the\\nTroops of the United States,\u201d commonly referred to as the Blue Book. The drill procedures initiated at Valley\\nForge were not changed for 85 years, until the American Civil War, and many of the drill terms and\\nprocedures are still in effect today.\\n1-7. Drill commands are about the same as at the time of the War of 1812, except that then the officers and\\nNCOs began them by saying, \u201cTake care to face to the right, right, face.\u201d Also, during the American\\nrevolutionary period, troops marched at a cadence of 76 steps per minute instead of the current cadence of\\n120 steps. (Cadence is the uniform rhythm in which a movement is executed, or the number of steps or\\ncounts per minute at which a movement is executed. Drill movements are normally executed at the\\ncadence of quick time or double-time. Quick time is the cadence of 120 counts or steps per minute;\\ndouble-time is the cadence of 180 counts or steps per minute.) Then units performed precise movement\\non the battlefield, and the Army that could best perform them was often able to get behind the enemy, or on\\ntheir flank, beating them. Speed ruined the winning exactness. Also, firearms shot neither far nor accurately\\nin 1776, so troop formations could take more time to approach the enemy.\\n1-8. As armament and weaponry improved, drill had to adapt to new tactical concepts. Although the\\nprocedures taught in drill today are not normally employed on the battlefield, the objectives accomplished\\nby drill\u2014professionalism, teamwork, confidence, pride, alertness, attention to detail, esprit de corps, and\\ndiscipline\u2014are just as important to the modern Army as they were to the Continental Army.\\nSECTION II \u2013 MILITARY MUSIC\\n1-9. Military music has been an integral part of the military since the U.S. Army was created. Drummers\\nhave provided beats to help with military drill. Bugles have been used on the battlefield to signal various\\nevents. Military musicians have been providing ceremonial music and performing in concerts to boost morale\\nsince the Revolutionary War. Cadence is sung in the morning to motivate and captivate Soldiers during\\nphysical training while keeping the formation in step. There are popular Country and Service songs played\\nat military functions that tell a story and instill pride in the force such as songs like \u201cBlood on the Risers\u201d\\nand \u201cBallad of the Green Beret,\u201d as well as marches like The Stars and Stripes Forever.\\n1-10. The earliest surviving pictorial, sculptured, and written records show musical or quasi-musical\\ninstruments employed in connection with military activity for signaling during encampments, parades, and\\ncombat. Because the sounds were produced in the open air, the instruments tended to be brass and percussion.\\nOriental, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and American Indian chronicles and pictorial remains show trumpets and\\ndrums of many varieties allied to Soldiers and battles.\\nNATIONAL AND MILITARY SERVICE MUSIC\\n1-11. Two of the most distinguished pieces of music in the Army are the national anthem and the official\\nArmy song. These two pieces of military music are played at almost every Army function and require Soldiers\\n1-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Introduction to Drill and Ceremony\\nto stand at attention and sing (as required with the playing of the Army song), or stand at attention and\\nsometimes render the hand salute (as required with the playing of the national anthem). These pieces of\\nmilitary music were written in turbulent times and have significant meaning to all Soldiers and most\\nU.S. citizens.\\nNATIONAL ANTHEM\\n1-12. Our national anthem officially became \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d by law on 3 March 1931, in\\nSection 301, Title 36, U.S Code. The national anthem was written from an inspirational event witnessed by\\nthe songwriter, Francis Scott Key, as the British Royal Navy conducted a 25-hour bombardment on Fort\\nMcHenry. Francis Scott Key observed \u201cOld Glory\u201d still waving at the Fort after the Royal Navy was\\nunsuccessful in destroying it.\\nOFFICIAL ARMY SONG\\n1-13. The official Army song, \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d was formally dedicated by the Secretary of\\nthe Army on Veterans Day, 11 November 1956, and was officially announced on 12 December 1957 (see\\nAR 220-90). In addition to standing at Attention during the playing of the official Army song, Army personnel\\nare required to sing the lyrics.\\nNote. Although there is no Department of Defense (DOD) directive\u2014no oral order given by a\\ncommander to direct or cause a subordinate leader or lead element to take action\u2014in this\\nregard, commanders, officers, and personnel from other military branches can encourage the\\ntribute to the Army by standing at Attention when the band plays \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along.\u201d\\nArmy personnel will stand at Attention during the playing of official songs of other branches of\\nService.\\nBUGLE CALLS\\n1-14. Bugle calls are used in U.S. military service as the result of the Continental Army\u2019s contact with\\nEuropean Soldiers and armies during the revolutionary period. After the American Revolution, many of the\\nFrench and English bugle calls and drum beats were adopted by the U.S. Army. Bugle calls are musical\\nsignals which announce scheduled and nonscheduled events on Army military bases. Appendix I, (table I-1\\non pages I-9 through I-11) gives detailed instruction of courtesies required to be rendered during bugle calls\\nplayed on military installations. See TC 1-19.10 for a full list and description of all the Army bugle calls.\\nThere are five classes of bugle calls: warning calls, formation calls, alarm calls, service calls, and ceremonial\\ncalls. Some of the most popular and significant bugle calls are\u2014\\n\\uf06c ATTENTION. This is taken from the British \u201cAlarm,\u201d at which call the troops turned out under\\narms. Attention is a parade bugle call letting Soldiers know that they are going to be called to the\\nPosition of Attention.\\n\\uf06c ADJUTANT\u2019S CALL. The adjutant\u2019s call indicates that the adjutant is about to form the guard,\\nbattalion, or regiment.\\n\\uf06c FIRST CALL. First call is the bugle call that signals to the troops as a warning that personnel will\\nprepare to assemble for a formation. This bugle call lets Soldiers know to move to the designated\\nformation area.\\n\\uf06c REVEILLE. Reveille is the bugle call played to signal the troops to awaken for morning roll call\\nand coincides with the raising of the national Color.\\n\\uf06c MESS CALL. The mess call is the bugle call that signals mealtime.\\n\\uf06c RETREAT. Retreat is the ceremony that pays honors to the national flag when it is lowered in the\\nevening.\\n\\uf06c TO THE COLOR. The old Cavalry call, \u201cTo the Standard,\u201d in use from about 1835, was replaced\\nby the present call of \u201cTo the Color.\u201d This bugle call is played immediately after the playing of\\nretreat.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 1-3Chapter 1\\n\\uf06c TATTOO. Tattoo is a popular bugle call that is played later in the evening prior to \u201cTaps\u201d and\\nsignals to Soldiers that all loud talking and other disturbances must be discontinued within\\n15 minutes.\\n\\uf06c \u201cTAPS.\u201d \u201cTaps\u201d is played on some military installations late in the evening as it signals \u201clights\\nout\u201d (extinguish all unauthorized lights). \u201cTaps\u201d was adapted by Union General Daniel Butterfield\\nfor his brigade back in July of 1862. \u201cTaps\u201d is also played at military funerals and is known to be\\none of the military\u2019s most recognizable and emotional bugle call.\\n\\uf06c SOUND OFF. Although technically not a bugle call, the \u201cSound Off\u201d performed by the band in\\nceremonies is derived from the tradition of using bugles to signal and rally troops. The band, in\\nplace, plays \u201cSound Off\u201d (three chords). It then moves forward and, changing direction while\\nplaying a stirring march, troops the line and marches past the Soldiers in formation, then returns\\nto its post\u2014the correct place for an officer or NCO to stand in a prescribed formation. Upon\\nhalting, the band again plays three chords. Sound Off is a parade bugle call.\\n1-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 2\\nDrill Instructions\\n\u201cTroops who march in an irregular and disorderly manner are always in great danger\\nof being defeated.\u201d\\nVegetius: De Re Militari: A.D. 378\\nSECTION I \u2013 INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS\\nThe progress made by individuals and units in precise and unified action in drill is determined by the\\nfollowing:\\n\\uf06c The methods of instruction and the thoroughness of the instructor.\\n\\uf06c The organization of Soldiers into units of the most effective instructional size.\\nThe three methods of instruction used to teach drill to Soldiers are: step by step, talk-through, and by\\nthe numbers. The character of the movement being taught will indicate the most effective method to use. As\\na rule, marching movements are taught using the step-by-step method. Movements that require numerous or\\nsimultaneous actions by an individual or unit are best taught using the talk-through method. Movements that\\nhave two or more counts are taught using the by-the-numbers method.\\nTo ensure that a Soldier develops satisfactory proficiency during the time allotted and to ensure a\\ncomplete and consistent presentation by the drill instructor, each movement, regardless of the method used,\\nshould be presented using three teaching stages\u2014\\n\\uf06c Explanation.\\n\\uf06c Demonstration.\\n\\uf06c Practice.\\nEXPLANATION\\nIn the explanation stage, the instructor must\u2014\\n\\uf06c Give the name of the movement.\\n\\uf06c Give the practical use for the movement.\\n\\uf06c Give the command(s) for the movement and explain its elements: the preparatory command and\\nthe command of execution.\\n\\uf06c Also discuss the command(s) necessary to terminate the movement. (Supplementary commands\\nare discussed where appropriate in the explanations.)\\nThis is how an instructor teaches a marching movement using the first teaching stage (explanation):\\n\u201cPlatoon, ATTENTION. AT EASE. The next movement (position), which I will name, explain, and have\\ndemonstrated, and which you will conduct practical work on, is the 30-Inch Step From the Halt. This\\nmovement is used to march an element from point A to point B in a uniform manner. The command to\\nexecute this movement is Forward, MARCH. This is a two-part command: Forward is the preparatory\\ncommand, and MARCH is the command of execution. The command to terminate this movement is HALT.\\nHalt is also a two-part command when preceded by a preparatory command such as Squad or Platoon. I will\\nuse Demonstrator as the preparatory command and HALT as the command of execution. When given, these\\ncommands are as follows: Forward, MARCH; Demonstrator, HALT.\u201d\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 2-1Chapter 2\\nDEMONSTRATION\\nIn the demonstration stage, the instructor may use the step-by-step, talk-through, or by-the-numbers\\nmethods of instruction. The instructor may demonstrate the movement themselves, modifying their position\\nwhen necessary to maintain eye-to-eye contact with personnel being instructed.\\nSTEP-BY-STEP METHOD OF INSTRUCTION\\nIn the step-by-step method of instruction, the explanation and demonstration are combined. The\\nmovements are taught one step at a time.\\nNote. The letters P, I, C, or A that have been added to the end of certain paragraphs to help the\\nreader understand the five-step process used in all marching movements comprise a mnemonic\\nknown as the PICAA effect. Put simply, the preparatory command, the command of execution,\\nand the action step\u2014executing the movement\u2014are all given or executed when the same foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. The intermediate step and additional step are executed with the other\\nfoot.\\nThe instructor explains that on the command of execution, the demonstrator takes only one step and\\nthen stops in position until the command Ready, STEP (for the next step) is given. While the demonstrator\\nis stopped in position, the instructor makes on-the-spot corrections and explains the actions for the next step.\\nThe instructor then has the demonstrator execute the movement at normal cadence.\\nThis is how an instructor teaches the demonstration stage when using the step-by-step method of\\ninstruction:\\n\\uf06c \u201cDemonstrator, POST. I will use the step-by-step method of instruction. On the preparatory\\ncommand Forward of Forward, MARCH, without noticeable movement, shift the weight of the\\nbody onto the right foot. Forward.\u201d\\n\\uf06c \u201cOn the command of execution MARCH of Forward, MARCH, step forward 30 inches with the\\nleft foot. The head, eyes, and body remain as in the Position of Attention. The arms swing in\\nnatural motion, without exaggeration and without bending the elbows, about 9 inches straight to\\nthe front and 6 inches straight to the rear of the trouser seams. The fingers and thumbs are curled\\nas in the Position of Attention, just barely clearing the trousers. MARCH.\u201d (Front is defined as\\nthe space from side to side of a formation, including the right and left elements.)\\n\\uf06c \u201cOn the command of execution STEP of Ready, STEP, execute a 30-inch step with the trail foot.\\nOnce again, ensure that the head, eyes, and body remain as in the Position of Attention, and that\\nthe arms swing naturally, without exaggeration, and without bending the elbows, about 9 inches\\nstraight to the front and 6 inches straight to the rear of the trouser seams. The fingers and thumbs\\nare curled, as in the Position of Attention, barely clearing the trousers. Ready, STEP. Notice that\\nthere are two steps explained: one from the Halt and one while marching.\u201d\\n\\uf06c \u201cThe command to terminate this movement is HALT. The preparatory command Demonstrator\\nof Demonstrator, HALT, may be given as either foot strikes the marching surface. However, the\\ncommand of execution HALT of Demonstrator, HALT, must be given the next time that same\\nfoot strikes the marching surface. The Halt is executed in two counts.\u201d\\n\\uf06c \u201cOn the command of execution STEP of Ready, STEP, execute a 30-inch step with the trail foot.\\nWhen that foot strikes the marching surface, the demonstrator will receive the preparatory\\ncommand Demonstrator of Demonstrator, HALT.

Each movement is orally described. In this method, the explanation and\\naction by individuals is executed as the instructor tells the demonstrators what they want them to do and how\\nto do it. The demonstrators execute the movement as the instructor describes it; then, the instructor has the\\ndemonstrators execute the movement at normal cadence.\\nThis is how an instructor teaches the demonstration stage when using the talk-through method of\\ninstruction:\\n\\uf06c \u201cDemonstrator, POST.

You will be my assistant instructor. FALL OUT.\u201d (Notice that\\nthere is no Ready, ONE command.)\\nPRACTICE\\nThe practice stage is executed in the same manner as the demonstration stage except that the instructor\\nuses the proper designator for the size of their element. However, the instructor does not have their element\\nexecute the movement at normal cadence until their element has shown a satisfactory degree of proficiency\\nexecuting the movement using the selected method of instruction.\\nSECTION II \u2013 INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES\\nBasic drill instruction includes U, line, circular, and extended rectangular formations. Basic drill\\ninstruction also includes stationary and moving cadence counts and dedicated instruction to units and\\nindividuals.\\nFORMATIONS\\nInstructors could use one of the four formation types when providing instructions to their formation\\nwhile conducting drill. In all phases of drill, instruction and practical work can best be presented by using\\nthe U-formation or line formation. As a rule, stationary movements are taught using the U-formation;\\nmarching movements, including squad, platoon, and company drills, are best taught from the line formation.\\nInstructors also have the option to use the extended rectangular and circular formations. Soldiers should be\\ntaught in the smallest formation possible to ensure individual attention; however, squad drill, whenever\\n2-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Drill Instructions\\npossible, should be taught to squad-size units, platoon drill to platoon-size units, and company drill to\\ncompany-size units.\\nU-FORMATION\\nThe U-formation is formed by the instructor commanding Count, OFF. On the command of execution\\nOFF of Count, OFF, all personnel, except the right flank personnel, turn their heads and eyes to the right\\nand the right flank personnel count off with \u201cONE.\u201d After the right flank Soldiers have counted their number,\\nthe Soldiers to their left count off with the next higher number and simultaneously turn their heads and eyes\\nto the front. All other members of the formation count off in the same manner until the entire formation has\\ncounted off. The instructor then commands First and second squads, FALL OUT.\\nOn the command of execution FALL OUT, the first squad faces to the right, and the second squad\\nfaces to the left. After the squads have faced, the instructor commands U-formation, FALL IN.\\nOn the command of execution FALL IN, the following actions happen simultaneously:\\n\\uf06c The first squad faces right, executes a Column Left, and takes one more step than the highest\\nnumber counted when the formation counted off; halts, and faces to the left without command.\\n\\uf06c The second squad faces left, marches forward until the lead Soldier clears the last vacated position\\nof the first squad, and then executes a Column Right, taking three more steps than the highest\\nnumber counted when the formation counted off; halts, and faces to the right without command.\\n\\uf06c The third squad stands fast, and the fourth squad executes one 15-Inch Step to the Left. The\\ninstructor ensures that the first and second squads are one step in front of and one step outside the\\nflanks of the third squad before commanding AT EASE beginning the instruction.\\nTo re-form the platoon in a line formation, the commands are: FALL OUT (pause); FALL IN. The\\nmembers of the platoon execute in the reverse manner as prescribed above, taking the same number of steps.\\nLINE FORMATION\\nWhen instructing using the line formation at normal interval, it is recommended that the first rank\\nkneels (right knee), second rank executes one 15-Inch Step to the Left and kneels (left knee), third rank stands\\nfast, and the fourth rank takes one 15-Inch Step to the Left. (Rank is a line that is one element in-depth.)\\nThe instructor adjusts any additional ranks as necessary to ensure they are uncovered. This formation can\\nquickly be formed by commanding Instructional Formation, MARCH. To re-form the unit into a line\\nformation, the command is FALL IN. The members of the platoon execute in the reverse manner as\\nprescribed above. (Normal interval is the lateral space between Soldiers, measured from right to left by\\nthe Soldier on the right holding their left arm shoulder high, fingers and thumb extended and joined,\\nwith the tip of their middle finger touching the right shoulder of the Soldier to their left.)\\nEXTENDED RECTANGULAR FORMATION\\nThe instructor may find using the extended rectangular formation more suitable for use:\\n\\uf06c To form the extended rectangular formation, the instructor commands Extend to the left,\\nMARCH. All right flank Soldiers stand fast with only their left arm extended sideward with palm\\ndown, fingers and thumbs extended and joined. All other Soldiers turn to the left and double-time\\nforward. After taking a sufficient number of steps, the Soldiers stop, face to the front, and extend\\nboth arms sideward with palms down, with fingers and thumbs extended and joined. The distance\\nbetween the fingertips of one Soldier to another is 12 inches, dress is to the right and cover to the\\nfront. The remainder of the body is in the Position of Attention. (Distance is defined as the space\\nbetween elements when the elements are one behind the other. Between units, it varies with\\nthe size of the formation; between individuals, it is an arm\u2019s length to the front plus 6 inches,\\nor about 36 inches, measured from the chest of one Soldier to the back of the Soldier\\nimmediately to their front.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Arms downward, MOVE. The Soldiers lower their arms sharply\\nto the sides as in the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Left, Face. All Soldiers execute a left face.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 2-5Chapter 2\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Extend to the left, MARCH. All Soldiers execute as previously\\ndescribed.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Arms downward, MOVE. All Soldiers execute as previously\\ndescribed.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Right, FACE. All Soldiers execute a right face.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands From front to rear, COUNT OFF. (COUNT OFF is the entire\\ncommand of execution.) Each member of the first rank turns their head and eyes to the right and\\ncounts off with ONE, then faces back to the front. The remaining ranks execute in the same\\nmanner as the first rank, counting off in the same manner as the first rank until the entire formation\\nhas counted off. The members of the last (rear) rank do not turn their heads and eyes.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Even numbers to the left, UNCOVER. All even-numbered\\nSoldiers jump squarely in the center of the interval, resuming the Position of Attention. The\\nformation is now prepared for instruction.\\n\\uf06c To return the formation to the original configuration, the instructor commands Assemble to the\\nright, MARCH. All Soldiers double-time to their original position in formation.\\nCIRCULAR FORMATION\\nThe instructor may find the circular formation more suitable for training:\\n\\uf06c The instructor positions themselves in front of the lead Soldier in the lead squad, looks over their\\nright shoulder, and commands Circle formation, FOLLOW ME. The instructor double-times in\\na circle large enough for the formation and moves to the center of the circle. The members of the\\nlead squad follow at an arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches (approximately 40 inches total). The squad\\nleaders of the following squads begin double-timing at the correct distance from the last Soldier\\nin the preceding squad without command. After the entire formation is in a circle, the instructor\\ncomes to the Position of Attention and commands Quick time, MARCH. The Soldiers begin\\nmarching normally. The instructor then gives directives to individual Soldiers and corrects the\\ndistance between them until each member is at approximately double arm interval.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands the formation to Halt using the appropriate preparatory command.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Left, FACE. All personnel face toward the instructor. The\\nformation is now ready for instruction.\\n\\uf06c To return the formation to its original configuration, the instructor commands the formation to\\nattention and commands FALL OUT, then FALL IN. On the command FALL IN, all Soldiers\\nreturn to their original position in formation.\\nNote. When conditions do not warrant this formation, Soldiers may be directed to remain standing\\nand to uncover. To assemble the unit, the command FALL IN is given.\\nINSTRUCTORS\\nWhen acting as instructors or assistant instructors, officers and NCOs go wherever they are needed.\\nThey correct mistakes and ensure steadiness and proper performance in ranks. When Soldiers shows that they\\nare unable to execute the proper movements or assume the proper position, the instructor may physically\\nassist them.\\nCADENCE COUNTING\\nTo enable Soldiers to learn or maintain cadence and develop rhythm, the instructor should have them\\ncount cadence while marching.\\nTo count cadence while marching at quick time, the instructor gives the preparatory command, Count\\nCadence, as the left foot strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution, COUNT, the next\\ntime the left foot strikes the marching surface. The Soldier begins to count the next time the left foot strikes\\nthe marching surface and counts as each foot strikes the marching surface\u2014ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR;\\n2-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Drill Instructions\\nONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. To count cadence while double-timing, the procedures are basically the same,\\nexcept the Soldier only counts each time the left foot strikes the marching surface. To maintain cadence when\\nmarching, Soldiers will be allowed to sing, or a drummer\u2019s beat may provide cadence.\\nFor stationary movements of two or more counts, the instructor commands In Cadence, Right, FACE.\\nSoldiers simultaneously execute the first count of the movement on the command of execution and sounds\\noff, ONE; as they execute the second count, they sound off, TWO.\\nNote. To halt execution of movements in cadence, the instructor commands Without Cadence,\\nand resumes normal drill methods. For example, Without Cadence, MARCH when marching at\\nCount Cadence or Without Cadence, Left, FACE for stationary movements.\\nAs Soldiers begin to master the art of drill, instructors encourage a spirit of competition among\\nindividuals and between units. Although repetition is necessary when teaching drill, instructors use\\ncompetitive drill exercises to ensure that drill does not become boring or monotonous.\\nMass commands are used to develop confidence and promote enthusiasm. They are effective in\\ndeveloping a command voice when instructing a leadership course. Procedures for using mass commands are\\ndiscussed in chapter 3.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 2-7This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 3\\nCommands and the Command Voice\\n\u201cThe spirit of discipline, as distinct from its outward and visible guises, is the result of\\nassociation with martial traditions and their living embodiment.\u201d\\nB. H. Liddell Hart, Thoughts on War, 1944\\nSECTION I \u2013 COMMANDS\\n3-1. A drill command is an oral order of a commander or leader. The precision with which a movement is\\nexecuted is affected by the way the command is given.\\nRULES\\n3-2. The following rules for giving commands apply to the commander when the unit drills as a separate\\nunit and not as part of a larger formation:\\n\\uf06c When at the Halt, the commander faces the troops when giving commands. On commands that set\\nthe unit in motion (marching from one point to another), the commander moves simultaneously\\nwith the unit to maintain correct position within the formation. (See chapter 4, paragraphs 4-7 and\\n4-27, for more information on facing in marching.)\\n\\uf06c When the commander is marching, without regard to the formation, the commander turns their\\nhead in the direction of the troops to give commands.\\n\\uf06c Exceptions to these rules occur during ceremonies, which are discussed in chapter 10.\\n\\uf06c When elements drill as part of a larger unit, the rules for supplementary commands apply (see\\nparagraph 3-6).\\n\\uf06c The commander gives the command AS YOU WERE to revoke a preparatory command that they\\nhave given. The command AS YOU WERE must be given before the command of execution.\\nThe commander cannot cancel the command of execution with AS YOU WERE. If an improper\\ncommand is not revoked, the personnel execute the movement in the best manner possible.\\nTWO-PART COMMANDS\\n3-3. Most drill commands have two parts: the preparatory command and the command of execution. Neither\\npart is a command by itself, but the parts are termed commands to simplify instruction. The commands Ready,\\nPort, ARMS, and Ready, Aim, FIRE, are considered two-part commands even though they contain two\\npreparatory commands. The following are the parts of the two-part commands:\\n\\uf06c Preparatory command. The preparatory command states the movement to be carried out and\\nmentally prepares the Soldier for its execution. In the command Forward, MARCH, the\\npreparatory command is Forward.\\n\\uf06c Command of execution. The command of execution tells when the movement is to be carried out.\\nIn Forward, MARCH, the command of execution is MARCH.\\n3-4. To change direction of a unit when marching, the preparatory command and command of execution\\nfor each movement are given so they begin and end on the foot in the direction of the turn: Right Flank,\\nMARCH is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface, and Left Flank, MARCH as the left foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. The interval between the preparatory command and the command of execution\\nis always one step or count. The preparatory command and command of execution are always given when\\nthe same foot strikes the marching surface.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 3-1Chapter 3\\nCOMBINED COMMANDS\\n3-5. In some commands, the preparatory command and the command of execution are combined; for\\nexample, FALL IN, AT EASE, and REST. These commands are given without inflection and at a uniformly\\nhigh pitch and loudness comparable to that for a normal command of execution.\\nSUPPLEMENTARY COMMANDS\\n3-6. Supplementary commands are verbal orders, given by a subordinate leader, that reinforce and\\ncomplement a commander\u2019s order. They ensure proper understanding and execution of a movement. They\\nextend to the lowest subordinate leader exercising control over an element affected by the command as a\\nseparate element within the same formation.\\n3-7. A supplementary command may be a preparatory command, a portion of a preparatory command, or a\\ntwo-part command. It is normally given between the preparatory command and the command of execution.\\nHowever, when a command requires an element of a unit to execute a movement different from other\\nelements within the same formation, or the same movement at a different time, subordinate leaders give their\\nsupplementary commands at the time prescribed by the procedures covering that particular movement.\\nExample:\\nThe platoon is in column formation, and the platoon leader commands Column of\\nTwos From the Left (pause), MARCH. The first and second squad leaders command\\nForward; the third and fourth squad leaders command STAND FAST. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the first and second squads march forward. At the\\nappropriate time, the squad leader (third squad) nearest the moving element\\ncommands Column Half Left, MARCH (for both remaining squads). As the third and\\nfourth squad leaders reach the line of march, they automatically execute a Column\\nHalf Left and obtain normal distance behind the first and second squads.\\n3-8. Subordinate leaders give all supplementary commands over their right shoulder except when their\\ncommand is based on the actions of an element on their left or when the subordinate is to execute a Column\\nLeft (Half Left) or Left Flank. Giving commands over the left shoulder occurs when changing configuration\\nor a formation, such as forming a file (column that has a front of one element) or a column of fours and\\nre-forming. (See chapter 7, paragraph 7-13, for more information on forming a file and re-forming.)\\nExample:\\nThe platoon is in column formation and is going to form a file to the left. The left flank\\nsquad leader will give the supplementary command Column, LEFT over the left\\nshoulder, since the movement will be to the left. The other squad leaders will give the\\nsupplementary command STAND FAST over the left shoulder as their movement will\\nbe to the left and is based on an element to the left.\\nNote. When in formation at present arms and the preparatory command Order of Order, ARMS\\nis given, subordinate leaders terminate their salute before giving their supplementary command.\\n3-9. Supplementary commands are not given by a subordinate leader for the combined commands FALL\\nIN, AT EASE, REST or for mass drill when their element forms as part of a massed formation. However,\\nsupplementary commands are given when forming a mass or when forming a column from a mass.\\n3-10. Except for commands while in mass formation, platoon leaders give supplementary commands\\nfollowing all preparatory commands of the commander. When the preparatory command is Company, the\\n3-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Commands and the Command Voice\\nplatoon leaders immediately come to Attention and command Platoon. The company commander allows for\\nall supplementary commands before giving the command of execution.\\n3-11. When no direction is given, the response is understood to be Forward; when no rate of march is given,\\nthe response is Quick Time. Normally, when a direction or rate of march is included in the preparatory\\ncommand, only the direction or rate of march is given as a supplementary command.\\nDIRECTIVES\\n3-12. Directives are oral orders given by the commander that direct or cause a subordinate leader to act. The\\ncommander gives directives rather than commands when it is more appropriate for subordinate elements to\\nexecute a movement or perform a task as independent elements of the same formation:\\n\\uf06c TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS is the only directive on which a commander relinquishes\\ntheir command and on which salutes are exchanged.\\n\\uf06c Directives are given in sentence form and are normally prefaced by the terms HAVE YOUR\\nUNITS or BRING YOUR UNITS.\\nExample:\\nHAVE YOUR UNITS Open Ranks and Stack Arms; BRING YOUR UNITS to Present\\nArms.\\nSECTION II \u2013 THE COMMAND VOICE\\n3-13. A correctly delivered command will be understood by everyone in the unit. Correct commands have a\\ntone, cadence, and snap that demand willing, correct, and immediate response.\\nVOICE CONTROL\\n3-14. The loudness of a command is adjusted to the number of Soldiers in the unit. Normally, the commander\\nis to the front and center of the unit and speaks facing the unit so that their voice reaches everyone. The voice\\nmust have carrying power, but excessive exertion is unnecessary and harmful. A typical result of trying too\\nhard is the almost unconscious tightening of the neck muscles to force sound out. This produces strain,\\nhoarseness, sore throat, and worst of all, indistinct and jumbled sounds instead of clear commands. Ease of\\ngiving proper commands is achieved through good posture, proper breathing, correct adjustment of throat\\nand mouth muscles, and confidence.\\n3-15. The best posture for giving commands is the Position of Attention. Soldiers in formation notice the\\nposture of their leader: if the leaders\u2019 posture is unmilitary\u2014relaxed, slouched, stiff, or uneasy\u2014the\\nsubordinates will imitate it.\\n3-16. The most important muscle used in breathing is the diaphragm\u2014the large muscle that separates the\\nchest cavity from the abdominal cavity. The diaphragm automatically controls normal breathing and is used\\nto control the breath in giving commands. The throat, mouth, and nose act as amplifiers and help to give\\nfullness (resonance) and projection to the voice.\\nDISTINCTIVENESS\\n3-17. Distinctiveness depends on the correct use of the tongue, lips, and teeth, which form the separate\\nsounds of a word and group the sounds into syllables. Distinct commands are effective; indistinct commands\\ncause confusion. All commands can be pronounced correctly without loss of effect. Emphasize correct\\nenunciation (distinctiveness). To enunciate clearly, make full use of the lips, tongue, and lower jaw.\\n3-18. To develop the ability to give clear, distinct commands, practice giving commands slowly and\\ncarefully, prolonging the syllables. Then, gradually increase the rate of delivery to develop proper cadence,\\nstill enunciating each syllable distinctly.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 3-3Chapter 3\\nINFLECTION\\n3-19. Inflection is the rise and fall in pitch and the tone changes of the voice. Inflection is going to change\\nwhen giving preparatory command, command of execution, and combined commands.\\n3-20. The preparatory command is the command that indicates movement. Pronounce each preparatory\\ncommand with a rising inflection. The most desirable pitch when beginning a preparatory command is near\\nthe level of the natural speaking voice. A common fault made by beginners is to start the preparatory\\ncommand in a pitch so high that, after employing a rising inflection for the preparatory command, it is\\nimpossible to give the command of execution with clarity and without strain. A good rule to remember: begin\\na command near the natural pitch of the voice (see figure 3-1).\\n3-21. The command of execution is the command that indicates when a movement is to be executed. Give it\\nin a sharper tone and in a slightly higher pitch than the last syllable of the preparatory command. It must be\\ngiven with plenty of snap. The best way to develop a command voice is to practice.\\n3-22. In combined commands, such as FALL IN and FALL OUT, the preparatory command and command\\nof execution are combined. Give these commands without inflection and with the uniform high pitch and\\nloudness of a normal command of execution.\\nFigure 3-1. Diagram of a command\\nCADENCE\\n3-23. Cadence, in commands, means a uniform and rhythmic flow of words. The interval between commands\\nis uniform in length for any given troop unit. This is necessary so that everyone in the unit can understand\\nthe preparatory command and will know when to expect the command of execution.\\n3-24. For the squad or platoon in March, except when supplementary commands need to be given, the\\ninterval of time is that which allows one step (or count) between the preparatory command and the command\\nof execution. The same interval is used for commands given at the Halt. Longer commands, such as\\nRight flank, MARCH, must be started so that the preparatory command will end on the proper foot, and\\nleave a full count between the preparatory command and command of execution.\\n3-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Commands and the Command Voice\\n3-25. When supplementary commands are necessary, the commander should allow for one count between\\nthe preparatory command and the subordinate leader\u2019s supplementary command, and an additional count\\nafter the subordinate command but before the command of execution.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 3-5This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 4\\nIndividual Drill\\n\u201cMaintain discipline and caution above all things, and be on the alert to obey the\\nword of command.

The explanation of a movement that may be executed toward either flank is given in this\\nchapter for only one flank. To execute the movement toward the opposite flank, substitute left for\\nright or right for left in the explanation.\\nSECTION I \u2013 STATIONARY MOVEMENTS\\n4-1. This section contains most of the individual positions and stationary movements required in drill. These\\npositions and the correct execution of the movement, in every detail, should be learned before proceeding to\\nother drill movements.\\n4-2. Movements are initiated from the Position of Attention. However, some rest movements may be\\nexecuted from other rest positions.\\nPOSITION OF ATTENTION\\n4-3. Two commands can be used to put personnel at the Position of Attention:\\n\\uf06c FALL IN is used to assemble a formation or return it to its original configuration.\\n\\uf06c The two-part command for Attention is used for Soldiers at a rest position. Assume the Position\\nof Attention on the command FALL IN or the command Squad (Platoon), ATTENTION.\\n4-4. To assume this position, bring the heels together sharply on line, with the toes pointing out equally,\\nforming a 45-degree angle. Rest the weight of the body evenly on the heels and balls of both feet. Keep the\\nlegs straight without locking the knees. Hold the body erect with the hips level, chest lifted and arched, and\\nshoulders square. Keep the head erect and face straight to the front with the chin drawn in so alignment of\\nthe head and neck is vertical.\\n4-5. Let the arms hang straight without stiffness. Curl the fingers so that the tips of the thumbs are alongside\\nand touching the first joint of the forefingers. Keep the thumbs straight along the seams of the trouser leg\\nwith the first joint of the fingers touching the trousers (see figure 4-1 on page 4-2). Remain silent and do not\\nmove unless otherwise directed.\\nNote. This position is assumed by enlisted Soldiers when addressing officers, or when officers are\\naddressing officers of superior rank.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-1Chapter 4\\nFigure 4-1. Position of attention\\nREST POSITIONS AT THE HALT\\n4-6. Any of the positions of rest may be commanded and executed from the Position of Attention. The\\nfollowing are rest positions that could be given at the halt:\\n\\uf06c Parade Rest. Parade Rest is commanded only from the Position of Attention. The command for\\nthis movement is Parade, REST.\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution REST, move the left foot about 10 inches to the left of the\\nright foot. Keep the legs straight without locking the knees, resting the weight of the body\\nequally on the heels and balls of the feet.\\n\\uf0a7 Simultaneously, place the hands at the small of the back and centered on the belt. Keep the\\nfingers of both hands extended and joined, interlocking the thumbs so that the palm of the\\nright hand is outward (see figure 4-2).\\n4-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill\\n\\uf0a7 Keep the head and eyes as in the Position of Attention. Remain silent and do not move unless\\notherwise directed. Stand at Ease, At Ease, and Rest may be executed from this position.\\nNote.

The command for this movement is Stand at, EASE. On the command of execution\\nEASE, execute Parade Rest, but turn the head and eyes directly toward the person in charge of\\nthe formation. At Ease or Rest may be executed from this position.\\n\\uf06c At Ease. The command for this movement is AT EASE. On the command AT EASE, Soldiers\\nmay move; however, they must remain standing and silent with their right foot in place. Soldiers\\nmay relax their arms with the thumbs interlaced. Rest may be executed from this position.\\n\\uf06c Rest. The command for this movement is REST. On the command REST, Soldiers may move,\\ntalk, or drink unless otherwise directed. They must remain standing with their right foot in place.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-3Chapter 4\\nAT EASE may be executed from this position to allow Soldiers to secure canteens, other\\nequipment, and so forth.\\nNote. On the preparatory command for Attention, immediately assume Parade Rest when at the\\nposition of Stand at Ease, At Ease, or Rest. If, for some reason, a subordinate element is already\\nat attention, the members of the element remain so and do not execute parade rest on the\\npreparatory command, nor does the subordinate leader give a supplementary command.\\nFACING AT THE HALT\\n4-7. There are five facing movements executed from the Position of Attention. They are Left (Right),\\nFACE, Half Left (Half Right), FACE, and About, FACE.\\nNote. Half Left (Half Right), FACE should only be used in situations when a 90-degree facing\\nmovement would not face an element in the desired direction (for example, for a stationary\\nelement to face the direction of the flag to render honors [reveille or retreat]).\\nFACING TO THE FLANK\\n4-8. Facing to the Flank is a two-count movement. The command is Left (Right), FACE:\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution FACE, slightly raise the right heel and left toe, and turn 90 degrees\\nto the left on the left heel, assisted by a slight pressure on the ball of the right foot. Keep the left\\nleg straight without stiffness and allow the right leg to bend naturally.\\n\\uf06c On count two, place the right foot beside the left foot, resuming the Position of Attention.

The Hand Salute is a one-count movement. The command is Present, ARMS. The Hand Salute may\\nbe executed while marching. When marching, only the Soldier in charge of the formation salutes and\\nacknowledges salutes. When double-timing, an individual Soldier must come to Quick Time before saluting.\\n4-11. When wearing headgear with a visor (with or without glasses), on the command of execution ARMS,\\nraise the right hand sharply, fingers and thumb extended and joined, palm facing down, and place the tip of\\nthe right forefinger on the rim of the visor slightly to the right of the right eye. The outer edge of the hand is\\nbarely canted downward so that neither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible from the front.\\nThe hand and wrist are straight, the elbow inclined slightly forward, and the upper arm horizontal (see\\nfigure 4-5, box 1).\\n4-12. When wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and wearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute\\nin the same manner as previously described in paragraph 4-11, except touch the tip of the right forefinger to\\nthat point on the glasses where the temple piece of the frame meets the right edge of the right brow (see\\nfigure 4-5, box 2).\\n4-13. When wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and not wearing glasses, execute the Hand\\nSalute in the same manner as previously described in paragraph 4-10, except touch the tip of the right\\nforefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right of the right eyebrow (see figure 4-5, box 3).\\n4-14. Order Arms from the Hand Salute is a one-count movement. The command is Order, ARMS. On the\\ncommand of execution ARMS, return the hand sharply to the side, resuming the Position of Attention.\\n4-15. When reporting or rendering courtesy to an individual, turn the head and eyes toward the person\\naddressed and simultaneously salute. In this situation, the actions are executed without command. The Salute\\nis initiated by the subordinate at the appropriate time (six paces) and terminated upon acknowledgment. (See\\nappendix A for more information on saluting.)\\nFigure 4-5. Hand salute\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-7Chapter 4\\nSECTION II \u2013 STEPS AND MARCHING\\n4-16. This section contains all the steps in marching of the individual Soldier. These steps should be learned\\nthoroughly before proceeding to unit drill.\\nBASIC MARCHING INFORMATION\\n4-17. This basic marching information pertains to all marching movements:\\n\\uf06c All marching movements executed from the Halt are initiated from the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c Except for Route Step March and At Ease March, all marching movements are executed while\\nmarching at Attention. Marching at Attention is the combination of the Position of Attention and\\nthe procedures for the prescribed step executed simultaneously.\\n\\uf06c When executed from the Halt, all steps except Right Step begin with the left foot.\\n\\uf06c For short-distance marching movements, the commander may designate the number of steps\\nforward, backward, or sideward by giving the appropriate command: One step to the right (left),\\nMARCH; or Two steps backward (forward), MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH,\\nstep off with the appropriate foot, and halt automatically after completing the number of steps\\ndesignated. Unless otherwise specified, when directed to execute steps forward, the steps will be\\n30-inch steps.\\n\\uf06c All marching movements are executed in the cadence of Quick Time (120 steps per minute) except\\nfor the 30-inch step, which may be executed in the cadence of 180 steps per minute on the\\ncommand Double Time, MARCH.\\n\\uf06c A step is the prescribed distance from one heel to the other heel of a marching Soldier.\\n\\uf06c All 15-inch steps are executed for a short distance only.\\nTHE 30-INCH STEP\\n4-18. To march with a 30-inch step from the Halt, the command is Forward, MARCH:\\n\\uf06c On the preparatory command Forward, shift the weight of the body to the right foot without\\nnoticeable movement. On the command of execution MARCH, step forward 30 inches with the\\nleft foot and continue marching with 30-inch steps, keeping the head and eyes fixed to the front.\\nThe arms swing in a natural motion, without exaggeration and without bending at the elbows,\\napproximately 9 inches straight to the front and 6 inches straight to the rear of the trouser seams.\\nKeep the fingers curled as in the Position of Attention so that the fingers just clear the trousers.\\n\\uf06c To Halt while marching, the command Squad (Platoon), HALT is given. The preparatory\\ncommand Squad (Platoon) is given as either foot strikes the marching surface as long as the\\ncommand of execution HALT is given the next time that same foot strikes the marching surface.\\nThe Halt is executed in two counts. After HALT is commanded, execute the additional step\\nrequired after the command of execution and then bring the trail foot alongside the lead foot,\\nassuming the Position of Attention and terminating the movement.\\nCHANGE STEP\\n4-19. This movement is executed automatically whenever Soldiers finds themselves out of step with all other\\nmembers of the formation. It is only executed while marching forward with a 30-inch step. To change step,\\nthe command Change Step, MARCH is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command\\nof execution MARCH, take one more step with the left foot, then, in one count, place the right toe near the\\nheel of the left foot and step off again with the left foot. Swing arms naturally.\\nMARCHING TO THE REAR\\n4-20. This movement is used to change the direction of a marching element 180 degrees in a uniform manner.\\nIt is only executed while marching forward with a 30-inch step. To March to the Rear, the command Rear,\\nMARCH is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH,\\n4-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill\\ntake one more step with the left foot, pivot 180 degrees to the right on the balls of both feet, and step off in\\nthe new direction taking a 30-inch step with the trail foot. Do not allow the arms to swing outward while\\nturning.\\nREST MOVEMENT, 30-INCH STEP\\n4-21. Rest movements with the 30-inch step include At Ease March and Route Step March:\\n\\uf06c At Ease March. The command At Ease, MARCH is given as either foot strikes the marching\\nsurface. On the command of execution MARCH, the Soldier is no longer required to retain\\ncadence; however, silence and the approximate interval and distance are maintained. Quick Time,\\nMARCH and Route Step, MARCH are the only commands that can be given while marching at\\nease.\\n\\uf06c Route Step March. Route Step March is executed identically to At Ease March except that Soldiers\\nmay drink from their canteens and talk.\\nNote. To change the direction of march while marching at Route Step or At Ease March, the\\ncommander informally directs the lead element to turn in the desired direction. Before precision\\nmovements may be executed, the unit must resume marching in cadence. The troops automatically\\nresume marching at Attention on the command Quick Time, MARCH as the commander\\nreestablishes the cadence by counting eight steps. If necessary, Soldiers individually execute\\nchange step to get back in step with the unit.\\nTHE 15-INCH STEP, FORWARD OR HALF STEP\\n4-22. Use the following procedures to execute the 15-inch step, forward or half step. The 15-inch step is\\ncommonly known as the Half Step:\\n\\uf06c To march with a 15-inch step from the Halt, the command is Half step, MARCH. On the\\npreparatory command Half Step, shift the weight of the body to the right foot without noticeable\\nmovement. On the command of execution MARCH, step forward 15 inches with the left foot and\\ncontinue marching with 15-inch steps. The arms swing as in marching with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c To alter the march to a 15-inch step while marching with a 30-inch step, the command is Half\\nStep, MARCH. This command may be given as either foot strikes the marching surface. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, take one more 30-inch step and then begin marching with a\\n15-inch step. The arms swing as in marching with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c To resume marching with a 30-inch step, the command Forward, MARCH is given as either foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take one more 15-inch step\\nand then begin marching with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c The Halt while marching at the Half Step is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from\\nthe 30-inch step. While marching at the Half Step, the only commands that may be given are:\\nMark Time, MARCH; Normal Interval, Forward, MARCH; MARCH; and HALT.\\nMARCHING IN PLACE\\n4-23. To march in place, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march in place, the command Mark Time, MARCH is given as either foot strikes the marching\\nsurface and only while marching with a 30-inch or 15-inch step forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, take one more step, bring the trailing foot alongside the leading foot, and\\nbegin to march in place. Raise each foot alternately 2 inches off the marching surface; the arms\\nswing naturally, as when marching with a 30-inch step forward.\\nNote. While marking time in formation, the Soldier adjusts position to ensure proper alignment\\nand cover. The proper distance between Soldiers while marching is one-arm length plus 6 inches\\n(approximately 40 inches).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-9Chapter 4\\n\\uf06c To resume marching with a 30-inch step, the command Forward, MARCH is given as either foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take one more step in place\\nand then step off with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c The Halt from Mark Time is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from the 30-inch step.\\nTHE 15-INCH STEP, RIGHT OR LEFT\\n4-24. To march with a 15-Inch Step Right (Left), use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march with a 15-Inch Step Right (Left), the command is Right (Left) Step, MARCH. The\\ncommand is given only while at the Halt. On the preparatory command of Right (Left) Step, shift\\nthe weight of the body without noticeable movement onto the left (right) foot. On the command\\nof execution MARCH, bend the right knee slightly and raise the right foot only high enough to\\nallow freedom of movement. Place the right foot 15 inches to the right of the left foot, then move\\nthe left foot (keeping the left leg straight) alongside the right foot as in the Position of Attention.\\nContinue this movement, keeping the arms at the sides as in the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c To Halt when executing Right or Left Step, the command is Squad (Platoon), HALT. This\\nmovement is executed in two counts. The preparatory command is given when the heels are\\ntogether; the command of execution HALT is given the next time the heels are together. On the\\ncommand of execution HALT, take one more step with the lead foot and then place the trailing\\nfoot alongside the lead foot, resuming the Position of Attention.\\nTHE 15-INCH STEP, BACKWARD\\n4-25. To march backward using the 15-inch step, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march with a 15-Inch Step Backward, the command is Backward, MARCH. The command is\\ngiven only while at the Halt. On the preparatory command Backward, shift the weight of the body\\nwithout noticeable movement onto the right foot. On the command of execution MARCH, take a\\n15-inch step backward with the left foot and continue marching backward with 15-inch steps. The\\narms swing naturally.\\n\\uf06c The Halt from Backward March is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from the 30-inch\\nstep.\\nTHE 30-INCH STEP, DOUBLE-TIME\\n4-26. To Double-Time using the 30-inch step, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march in the cadence of 180 steps per minute with a 30-inch step, the command is Double\\nTime, MARCH. It may be commanded while at the Halt or while marching at Quick Time with a\\n30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c When at the Halt and the preparatory command Double Time is given, shift the weight of the body\\nto the right foot without noticeable movement. On the command of execution MARCH, raise the\\nforearms to a horizontal position, with the fingers and thumbs closed, knuckles out, and\\nsimultaneously step off with the left foot. Continue to march with 30-inch steps at the cadence of\\nDouble Time. The arms swing naturally to the front and rear with the forearms kept horizontal.\\n(When armed, Soldiers will come to Port Arms on receiving the preparatory command of Double\\nTime.) Guides, when at Sling Arms, will Double-Time with their weapons at Sling Arms upon\\nreceiving the directive GUIDE ON LINE.\\n\\uf06c When marching with a 30-inch step in the cadence of Quick Time, the command Double Time,\\nMARCH is given as either foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution\\nMARCH, take one more 30-inch step at Quick Time and step off with the trailing foot,\\ndouble-timing as previously described.\\n\\uf06c To resume marching with a 30-inch step at Quick Time, the command Quick time, MARCH is\\ngiven as either foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take\\ntwo more 30-inch steps at double-time, lower the arms to the sides, and resume marching with a\\n30-inch step at Quick Time.\\n4-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill\\nNote. Quick Time, Column Half Left (Right), and Column Left (Right) are the only movements\\nthat can be executed while double-timing. Armed troops must be at Port Arms before the command\\nDouble Time, MARCH is given.\\nFACING IN MARCHING\\n4-27. Facings in Marching from the Halt are important parts of the following movements: alignments,\\ncolumn movements, inspecting Soldiers in ranks, and changing from Normal Interval to Double Interval or\\nDouble Interval to Normal Interval. (Double interval is defined as the lateral space between Soldiers,\\nmeasured from right to left by raising both arms shoulder high with the fingers extended and joined\\n[palms down] so that fingertips are touching the fingertips of the Soldiers to the right and to the left.):\\n\\uf06c For instructional purposes only, the command Face to the Right (Left) in Marching, MARCH\\nmay be used to teach the individual to execute the movement properly. On the preparatory\\ncommand Face to the Right (Left) in Marching, shift the weight of the body without noticeable\\nmovement onto the right foot. On the command of execution MARCH, pivot to the right (left) on\\nthe ball of the right foot (90 degrees) and step off in the indicated direction with the left foot.\\nExecute the pivot and step in one count and continue marching in the new direction. (See\\nparagraph 4-17, third bullet, and chapter 3, paragraph 3-2, first bullet.)\\n\\uf06c Facing to the Half-Right (Half-Left) in Marching from the Halt is executed in the same manner as\\nFacing to the Right (Left) in Marching from a Halt, except the facing movement is made at a\\n45-degree angle to the right (left).\\n\\uf06c The Halt from Facing in Marching is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from the\\n30-inch step.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-11This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 5\\nIndividual Drill with Weapons\\n\u201cFeed \u2018em up and give \u2018em hell.

When performing duty requiring the\\nuse of the magazine, the carbine is carried at Sling Arms.\\n\\uf06c The command Port, ARMS must be given before the command for Double Time.\\n\\uf06c Facings, alignments, and short-distance marching movements are executed from Order Arms or\\nSling Arms. When the movement has been completed, automatically return the carbine to\\nOrder Arms.\\n5-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill with Weapons\\n\\uf06c Facing movements are executed from Order Arms or Sling Arms. When a Facing is necessary to\\nestablish the direction of march, the Facing movement is executed before the command for the\\nmanual of arms. After a marching movement has been completed, Order, ARMS or Sling, ARMS\\nis commanded before the command for the facing movement.\\n\\uf06c Ready, Port, ARMS must be commanded following Inspection Arms and before any other\\nmovements can be commanded.\\n\\uf06c Port Arms is the key position assumed in most manual of arms movements from one position to\\nanother except Right Shoulder Arms from Order Arms and Order Arms from Right Shoulder Arms.\\n\\uf06c Manual of arms movements are a combination of the Position of Attention and the procedures for\\nthe prescribed movement. Most manual of arms movements are executed with the head, eyes, and\\nbody as in the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c Sling Arms is the appropriate position assumed to carry the carbine while marching in most\\nsituations. Port Arms is only used when slings are unavailable or unless specifically required by\\nlocal conditions.\\nNote. Paragraphs 5-2 through 5-9 refer to slings tight. However, all individual and unit drill\\nmovements may be executed with slings loose except when executing Fix Bayonets and Unfix\\nBayonets.\\nORDER ARMS\\n5-3.

This section describes the formations and movements of a squad. Individual drill movements and the\\nmanual of arms are executed, as previously described in chapters 4 and 5, while performing as a squad\\nmember.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n6-2. The squad has two prescribed formations\u2014line and column. However, the squad may be formed into\\na column of twos from a column formation. When the squad is in line, squad members are numbered from\\nright to left; when in column, from front to rear. The squad normally marches in column, but for short\\ndistances it may march in line.\\n6-3. When the squad drills as a separate unit, the squad leader carries their weapon at Sling Arms. When\\nthe squad is in a line formation, the squad leader assumes a post three steps in front of and centered on the\\nsquad; when in a column or a column of twos, three steps to the left and centered on the squad. When the\\nsquad drills as part of a larger unit, the squad leader occupies the number one (base) position of the squad.\\nSquad leaders carry their weapon in the same manner as prescribed for other rifle bearers in the squad.\\nFORMING THE SQUAD\\n6-4. The squad normally forms in a line formation; however, it may re-form in column when each member\\ncan identify their exact position (equipment grounded) in the formation (see figure 6-1 on page 6-3).\\n6-5. To form at normal interval, the squad leader comes to the Position of Attention and commands\\nFALL IN. On the command FALL IN, the following actions occur simultaneously:\\n\\uf06c Each member double-times to their position in the formation.\\n\\uf06c The right flank Soldier positions themselves so that when the squad is formed it is three steps in\\nfront of and centered on the squad leader.\\n\\uf06c The right flank Soldier comes to the Position of Attention and raises their left arm laterally at\\nshoulder level, elbow locked, fingers and thumb extended and joined, and palm facing down. They\\nensure that the left arm is in line with the body.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier to the immediate left of the right flank Soldier comes to the Position of Attention,\\nturns their head and eyes to the right, and raises their left arm in the same manner as the right flank\\nSoldier. They obtain proper alignment by taking short steps forward or backward until they are on\\nline with the Soldiers on their right flank. They then obtain exact interval by taking short steps left\\nor right until their shoulder touches the extended fingertips of the Soldier on their right flank. As\\nsoon as the Soldier to the left has obtained equal interval, each Soldier individually lowers their\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-1Chapter 6\\narm to their side, sharply turns their head and eyes to the front, and assumes the Position of\\nAttention.\\n\\uf06c The right flank Soldier then sharply returns to the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c All other members of the squad form in the same manner except that the Soldiers on the left flank\\ndo not raise their left arm.\\nNote. Right flank Soldiers raise their arms and look straight to the front unless the squad is to align\\non an element to its right. If they are to align on an element to the right, they turn their head and\\neyes to the right and align themselves with that element.\\n6-6. To form at Close Interval, the formation is completed in the manner prescribed for Normal Interval,\\nexcept that the command is At Close Interval, FALL IN as seen in figure 6-1. Squad members obtain Close\\nInterval by placing the heel of the left hand on the left hip even with the waist, fingers and thumb joined and\\nextended downward, and with the elbow in line with the body and touching the arm of the Soldier to the left\\nas seen in figure 6-3 on page 6-6.\\n6-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nFigure 6-1. Squad formation\\n6-7. To form in column, the squad leader faces the proposed flank of the column and commands In Column,\\nFALL IN. On the command of execution FALL IN, squad members double-time to their original positions\\n(grounded equipment) in formation and cover on the Soldier to their front.\\nNote. The correct distance between Soldiers in column formation is approximately 36 inches. This\\ndistance is one-arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches.\\n6-8. When armed, squad members fall in at Order Arms or Sling Arms. For safety, the commands\\nInspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; and Order (Sling), ARMS are commanded at the initial formation\\nof the day or when the last command is DISMISSED.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-3Chapter 6\\nCOUNTING OFF\\n6-9. The squad may count off in line or column formation. The command is Count, OFF:\\n\\uf06c When the squad is in a line formation, the counting is executed from right to left. On the command\\nof execution OFF, each member, except the Soldiers on the right flank, turns their head and eyes\\nto the right, and the right flank Soldier counts off \u201cONE.\u201d After the Soldier on the right counts off\\ntheir number, the Soldier to their left counts off with the next higher number and simultaneously\\nturns their head and eyes to the front. All the other members execute count off in the same manner\\nuntil the entire squad has counted off.\\n\\uf06c When the squad is in column formation, the counting is executed from front to rear. On the\\ncommand of execution OFF, the Soldier at the head of the column turns their head and eyes to the\\nright and counts over their shoulder, \u201cONE.\u201d After counting off their number, they immediately\\ncome to the Position of Attention. All other members count their numbers in sequence in the same\\nmanner as the number one Soldier; the last Soldier in the file does not turn their head and eyes to\\nthe right.\\nCHANGING INTERVAL WHILE IN LINE\\n6-10. To change interval while in line, use the following procedures:\\nNote. To ensure that each member understands the number of steps to take, the squad leader should\\ncommand Count, OFF before giving any commands that cause the squad to change interval.\\nMembers do not raise their arms when changing interval.\\n6-11. To obtain Close Interval from Normal Interval, the command is Close Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank (number one person) stands fast. All Soldiers\\nto the left of the number one person execute Right Step March, take one step less than their number (for\\nexample, number five person takes four steps), and Halt.\\nNote. The squad leader takes the correct number of steps to maintain their position of three steps\\nin front of and centered on the squad.\\n6-12. To obtain Normal Interval from Close Interval, the command is Normal Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank stands fast. All Soldiers to the left of number\\none person execute Left Step March, take one step less than their number (for example, the number nine\\nperson takes eight steps), and Halt.\\n6-13. To obtain Double Interval from Normal Interval, the command is Double Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank stand fast. All Soldiers to the left of the\\nnumber one person face to the left as in marching, take one 30-inch step less than their number (for example,\\nnumber seven person takes six steps), Halt, and execute Right Face.\\n6-14. To obtain Normal Interval from Double Interval, the command is Normal Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank stand fast. All Soldiers to the left of the\\nnumber one person face to the right as in marching, take one 30-inch step less than their number (for example,\\nnumber three person takes two steps), Halt, and execute Left Face.\\nALIGNMENT\\n6-15. Soldiers align front-to-back by covering on the Soldier to their front and align side-to-side by dressing\\nto the Soldier on their right. To cover, Soldiers position their heads, spines, and insides of the heels directly\\nbehind the corresponding locations of the Soldier in front of them. Soldiers dress by ensuring their shoulders\\nare perpendicular to the direction of march and their insteps are in line with the Soldier to their front.\\nFigure 6-2 shows Soldiers properly aligned at Normal Interval.\\n6-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nFigure 6-2. Proper alignment at normal interval\\nALIGNING THE SQUAD\\n6-16. To align the squad at Normal Interval, the commands are Dress Right, DRESS and Ready, FRONT.\\nThese commands are given only when armed Soldiers are at Order Arms or Sling Arms. On the command of\\nexecution DRESS, the Soldiers on the right flank stand fast. Each member, except the right flank person,\\nturns their head and eyes to the right and aligns themselves with the person on their right. Each member,\\nexcept the left flank person, extends their left arm laterally at shoulder level, elbow locked, fingers and thumb\\nextended and joined, palm facing down. They ensure their left arm is in line with their body and position\\nthemselves by short steps right or left until their right shoulder touches the fingertips of the Soldier on their\\nright. On the command of execution FRONT, each member returns sharply to the Position of Attention (see\\nfigure 6-3 on page 6-6).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-5Chapter 6\\nNote. The squad leader commands the squad to the appropriate interval before giving the\\ncommand for alignment.\\nFigure 6-3. Alignment (close interval)\\n6-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nNote. If the squad leader wants exact alignment, on the command of execution DRESS, they face\\nto the Half Left in marching and march by the most direct route to a position on line with the squad,\\nhalt one step from the Soldiers on the right flank, and face down the line. From their position, they\\nverify the alignment of the squad, directing the Soldiers to move forward or backward, as\\nnecessary, calling them by name or number: \u201cPrivate Miller, forward 2 inches;\u201d \u201cNumber eight,\\nbackward 4 inches.\u201d The squad leader remains at attention, taking short steps to the right or left as\\nnecessary to see down the squad. Having aligned the squad, they center themselves on the right\\nflank person by taking short steps left or right. The squad leader then faces to the Half Right in\\nmarching, returns to their position (center of the squad), halts perpendicular to the formation, faces\\nto the left, and commands Ready, FRONT. These procedures also apply when aligning the squad\\nat Close or Double Interval.\\n6-17. To align the squad at Close Interval, the commands are At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS and\\nReady, FRONT. The movement is executed in the same manner prescribed for alignment at Normal Interval\\nexcept that the squad members obtain Close Interval (see figure 6-3, page 6-6).\\n6-18. To align the squad at Double Interval, the commands are At Double Interval, Dress Right, DRESS\\nand Ready, FRONT. These commands are given only when the troops are unarmed or at Sling Arms. On the\\ncommand of execution DRESS, each member (except the right flank Soldier) turns their head and eyes to\\nthe right and aligns themselves to the person to their right. At the same time, each member (except the right\\nand left flank person) extends both arms and positions themselves by short steps right or left until their\\nfingertips are touching the fingertips of the members on their right and left. (The right flank person raises\\ntheir left arm; the left flank person raises their right arm.)\\n6-19. To align the squad in column, the commands are COVER and RE-COVER. On the command\\nCOVER, each member (except the number one person) raises their left arm to a horizontal position, elbow\\nlocked, fingers and thumb extended and joined, palm facing down, and obtains an arm\u2019s length plus about\\n6 inches (from the fingertips) to the back of the Soldier to their front. At the same time, each Soldier aligns\\nthemselves directly behind the Soldier to their front. To resume the Position of Attention, the command RE-\\nCOVER is given. On this command, each member sharply returns to the Position of Attention.\\nMARCHING THE SQUAD\\n6-20. To march the squad, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c For short distances only, the squad may be marched forward while in a line formation.\\n\\uf06c When marching long distances, the squad is marched in column.\\n\\uf06c To form a column formation from a line formation, the command is Right, FACE.\\n\\uf06c When a column formation is originated from a line formation at Close Interval, the squad may be\\nmarched for short distances at the Half Step with less than correct distance. To obtain correct\\ndistance while marching with less than correct distance, the command is Extend, MARCH. On\\nthe command of execution MARCH, the number one person takes one more 15-inch step and then\\nsteps off with a 30-inch step. Each squad member begins marching with a 30-inch step at the\\napproximate point where the number one person stepped off, or as soon as correct distance has\\nbeen obtained.\\nNote. See chapter 4 for more information on marching movements.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF A COLUMN\\n6-21. To change the direction of a column from the Halt, the command to start the squad in motion and\\nsimultaneously change the direction of march 90 or 45 degrees is Column Right (Left), MARCH or Column\\nHalf Right (Left), MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH, the lead person faces to the right (left)\\nas in marching by pivoting to the right (left) on the ball of the right foot and steps off in the indicated direction\\ntaking a 30-inch step with the left foot and continues to march. The number two Soldier adjusts their step by\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-7Chapter 6\\nlengthening or shortening as necessary to reach the approximate pivot point of the lead person. When they\\nreach the approximate pivot point of the lead Soldier, they pivot to the right (left) on the ball of the lead foot\\ntaking a 30-inch step with the trail foot in the new direction. All other members step off with the left foot and\\ncontinue to march forward taking 30-inch steps and execute in the same manner as the number two person in\\napproximately the same place until the entire squad has executed the column movement.\\n6-22. To change the direction of march 90 or 45 degrees when marching, the preparatory command Column\\nRight (Left) or Column Half Right (Half Left) is given as the foot (in the desired direction) strikes the\\nmarching surface. The command of execution MARCH is given the next time the foot in the desired direction\\nstrikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the lead person takes one additional\\nstep, pivots in the commanded direction as the pivot foot strikes the marching surface and continues to march\\nin the new direction. Other members continue to march forward and execute the pivot as prescribed from the\\nHalt.\\n6-23. To avoid an obstacle in the line of march, the squad leader directs INCLINE LEFT (RIGHT). The\\nlead person inclines Left (Right) around the obstacle and resumes the original direction. All other members\\nfollow the lead person.\\nMARCHING TO THE REAR\\n6-24. The command Rear, MARCH is given to the squad to change the direction of the marching element\\n180 degrees, in a uniform manner. Just like in individual drill (see paragraph 4-20), this movement is executed\\nwhile marching forward with a 30-inch step. To March to the Rear, the command Rear, MARCH is given\\nas the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take one more step\\nwith the left foot, pivot 180 degrees to the right on the balls of both feet, and step off in the new direction\\ntaking a 30-inch step with the trail foot. Do not allow the arms to swing outward while turning.\\nMARCHING TO THE FLANK\\n6-25. The squad may be marched to the flank (for short distances only) when marching in column. The\\ncommand for this movement is Right (Left) Flank, MARCH. The preparatory command is given as the foot\\nin the desired direction strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution is given the next time\\nthe foot in the desired direction strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, all\\nmembers take one more step, pivot 90 degrees in the commanded direction on the ball of the lead foot, and\\nstep off in the new direction with the trailing foot. As the members begin to march in the new direction, they\\nglance out of the corner of their right eye and dress to the right.\\nFORMING A COLUMN OF TWOS AND RE-FORMING\\n6-26. To form a column of twos and re-form, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c Forming a column of twos from a file is executed only from the Halt. The command is Column\\nof Twos to the Right (Left), MARCH. On the preparatory command, the lead team leader\\ncommands STAND FAST. The trailing team leader commands Column Half Right (Left). On\\nthe command of execution MARCH, the trailing team leader executes a Column Half Right\\n(Left), inclines to the left or right when the correct interval is obtained, and commands Mark time,\\nMARCH and Team, HALT to Halt abreast of the lead team leader.\\n\\uf06c Forming a file from a column of twos is executed only from the Halt. The command is File from\\nthe Left (Right), MARCH. On the preparatory command, the lead team leader commands\\nFORWARD. The trailing team leader commands STAND FAST. On the command of execution\\nMARCH, the lead team marches forward. The trailing team leader commands Column Half Left\\n(Right) when the second person from the rear of the lead team is abreast. They give the command\\nMARCH when the last person of the lead team is abreast of them and their right foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. They then incline right or left to follow the lead team at the correct distance.\\n6-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nNote. Commands are given over the team leader\u2019s right shoulder if the direction of movement is\\nto the right or if the team is following an element to its right. Commands are given over the left\\nshoulder if the direction of movement is to the left or if the team is following an element to its left.\\nDISMISSING THE SQUAD\\n6-27. The squad is dismissed with the members at Attention. With armed troops, the commands are\\nInspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS; and DISMISSED. With unarmed troops,\\nthe command is DISMISSED.\\nNote. Unless otherwise stated (by the person in charge in their instructions before the command\\nDISMISSED), the command DISMISSED terminates only the formation, not the duty day.\\n6-28. The command Fall Out will only be used when an individual or individuals are being removed from\\nthe formation and the entire formation is not being dismissed. For example, Sergeant Jones, Fall Out or\\nThird Squad, Fall Out. In this situation, the remainder of the formation would stay at the current\\nconfiguration until the command Dress Right, Dress (At Close Interval, Dress Right, Dress) or Cover are\\ngiven.\\nSECTION II \u2013 STACK AND TAKE ARMS (M4-SERIES CARBINE)\\n6-29. The squad members execute Stack and Take Arms from their positions in line formation (at Normal\\nInterval) from Order Arms. When in line formation, the squad leader commands Count, OFF and then\\ndesignates the stack person by numbers (for example, 2-5-8).\\nNotes. 1. M4-series carbines are not compatible with the M16-series rifles when stacking arms.\\nThe two types of weapons must be stacked separately or grounded in a manner that will not\\ndamage the sights. (See appendix C for a detailed explanation of Stack Arms and Take Arms for\\nthe M14-series rifle.)\\n2. When the squad is part of a larger unit, stack arms may be executed in a column formation\\n(when the formation consists of three or more files and the squads are at normal interval). Second\\nor third squad is designated as the stack squad.\\nPREPARE SLINGS\\n6-30. After the stack person is designated, the squad leader then commands Prepare, SLINGS. On the\\ncommand of execution SLINGS, each stack person (or stack squad) reaches across the body with their left\\nhand and grasp the handguards just above the slip ring. With the right hand they place the butt on the right\\nhip and cradles the carbine in the crook of the right arm. Using both hands, they adjust the sling keeper so\\nthat a 2-inch loop is formed from the sling keeper to the upper sling swivel. As soon as the loop is prepared,\\nthey return to Order Arms.\\nSTACK ARMS\\n6-31. When all stack personnel have returned to Order Arms, the squad leader commands Stack, ARMS. On\\nthe command of execution ARMS, each stack person reaches across the body with the left hand and grasps\\nthe handguards just above the slip ring. Designated stack persons then grasp the barrel of their carbine with\\ntheir right hand and place the carbine directly in front of and centered on their body with the sling side to the\\nfront. The butt (fully extended) is placed on the marching surface so that the heel of the butt (or side of the\\nbutt if the sling is side mounted) is on line with the toes of the stack person\u2019s footgear. Stack persons bend\\ndeeply forward at the waist and grasp their carbine with their left hand at the upper portion of the handguard,\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-9Chapter 6\\nkeeping the carbine vertical at all times. The first two fingers of the left hand hold the inner part of the loop\\nagainst the carbine. Stack persons reach across the front of the carbine with their right hand, grasp the outer\\npart of the loop, and hold it open for insertion of other carbines (see figure 6-4 on page 6-11).\\n6-32. On the command of execution ARMS, the Soldiers to the right and left of the stack person perform the\\nfollowing movements simultaneously:\\n\\uf06c The Soldier on the stack person\u2019s right reach across the body with the left hand and grasps the\\nhandguard. They release the grasp of their right hand and regrasp the carbine at the small of the\\nstock. They lower both arms with the elbows locked (holding the carbine in a horizontal position\\nwith the muzzle to the left and the magazine well to the front).\\n\\uf06c The Soldier on the stack person\u2019s left reaches across the body with the left hand and grasps the\\ncarbine at the small of the stock, releases the right hand, and regrasps the handguard. They then\\nlower both arms with the elbows locked (holding the carbine in a horizontal position with the\\nmuzzle to the right and magazine well to the front).\\n6-33. As soon as the stack person has placed their carbine in position, both Soldiers move the foot nearest\\nthe stack person halfway (Half Right or Half Left) toward the stack person. The Soldier on the stack person\u2019s\\nleft inserts the muzzle of their carbine into the loop to a point about halfway between the flash suppressor\\nand the front sight assembly. They hold their carbine in this position until the Soldier on the stack person\u2019s\\nright inserts the muzzle of their carbine in a similar manner and above the other muzzle.\\n6-34. Without moving the feet, both Soldiers swing the butt of their carbines out and then down to the\\nmarching surface, making the stack tight with the butts of the carbines on line and about 1 foot from the base\\nline. When the stack has been completed, all three Soldiers resume the Position of Attention.\\n6-35. Additional carbines are passed to the nearest stack on the right (right or left if stacked in column). The\\nSoldier with additional rifles grasps the handguards with the left hand, release the grasp of the right hand and\\nregrasps the weapon at the barrel. The Soldiers release the grasp of the left hand and raise the carbine\\nvertically with the magazine well to the front, wrist held shoulder high, elbow locked, and right arm extended\\nto the right front. Throughout the pass, the carbine is held vertical with the magazine well to the front:\\n\\uf06c The Soldier to the left of the stack person then grasps the carbine at the handguard with their left\\nhand. The Soldier passing the additional carbine then releases the carbine and sharply returns to\\nthe Position of Attention. The Soldier to the left of the stack person then moves the carbine to the\\nright until it is centered on their body, and they grasp the barrel with their right hand, wrist held\\nshoulder high and elbow locked. They then release the left hand and sharply returns their left hand\\nto the left side as in the Position of Attention. They then move the carbine to their right front.\\n\\uf06c The stack person receives the carbine and centers it in the same manner as previously described\\nin paragraph 6-33. The Soldier to the left of the stack person sharply returns to the Position of\\nAttention after they release the carbine. Once the stack person has centered the carbine and grasped\\nthe barrel with the right hand, they bend forward at the waist and places the carbine in the stack\\nso that it is secure (without damaging the front sight assembly). If there are two additional carbines,\\nthe second carbine is passed in the same manner as the first.\\nTAKE ARMS\\n6-36. To Take Arms, the command is Take, ARMS. On the command of execution ARMS, the Soldier return\\nthe additional carbines in the same manner as the carbines were received. The stack person secures the stack\\nand holds the loop in the same manner as for stacking carbines. The Soldiers on the left and right step toward\\nthe stack person in the same manner as when stacking arms. Each Soldier reaches down and regrasps their\\ncarbine (one hand at the small of the stock and one hand midway of the handguard) and brings it to the\\nhorizontal position. The Soldier on the right frees their carbine first and resumes Order Arms. The Soldier on\\nthe left frees their carbine and resumes Order Arms. The stack person cradles their carbine and adjusts the\\nsling and sling keeper to its original position and then resumes Order Arms.\\n6-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nFigure 6-4. Stack weapons (M4)\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-11This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 7\\nPlatoon Drill\\n\u201cIf in training Soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be\\nwell-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\u201d\\nSun Tsu, On the Art of War, trans. 1910\\nSECTION I \u2013 FORMATIONS\\n7-1. The platoon has two prescribed formations\u2014line and column (see figure 7-1 on page 7-2 and figure 7-2\\non page 7-3). However, the platoon may be formed into a file or a column of twos from a column formation.\\nWhen in a line formation, the elements (squads) of a platoon are numbered from front to rear; in a column\\nformation, from left to right.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-1Chapter 7\\nFigure 7-1. Line formation\\n7-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\nFigure 7-2. Column formation\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n7-2. For the most part, platoon drill merely provides the procedures for executing drill movements in\\nconjunction with other squads formed in the same formation. Individual drill movements and the manual of\\narms are executed, as previously described in chapters 4, 5, and 6, while performing as a squad member\\nduring the conduct of platoon drill. For continuity purposes in this chapter, \u201cplatoon sergeant\u201d may also\\ndenote \u201cplatoon leader\u201d when the platoon sergeant is executing drill from their post.\\n7-3. During all drill and ceremonies, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant carry their rifles at Sling Arms.\\nWhen the platoon drills as part of a larger unit, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant remain at Sling Arms\\nduring all manual of arms movements except when executing the Hand Salute while at Sling Arms.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-3Chapter 7\\n7-4. When the platoon drills as a separate unit or as part of a larger unit in a line formation, without officers\\npresent, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps in front of and centered on the platoon. When in\\ncolumn formation, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps to left flank of and centered on the platoon.\\nThe post for the platoon sergeant with the platoon leader present is one step to the rear and centered on the\\nplatoon in line or column formation.\\n7-5. When assuming their post in column from a line formation with the platoon leader present, the platoon\\nsergeant faces to the left in marching (on the command of execution FACE) and marches in the most direct\\nroute to their post. The platoon sergeant then halts and faces to the right. When assuming their post in line\\nfrom a column formation, they face to the right in marching (on the command of execution FACE) and march\\nin the most direct route to their post, halt centered on the platoon, and face to the left.\\nNote. When the files (columns) are uneven, the platoon sergeant normally directs the Soldiers in\\nlonger files to move to another file to balance the formation or may fill the vacancy themselves as\\nthe last person in the right file.\\n7-6. When control of the formation is being exchanged between the platoon sergeant and the platoon leader,\\nthe platoon sergeant will always travel around the right flank (squad leader) of the formation when marching\\nfrom post to post. The platoon leader will always travel around the left flank of the formation when marching\\npost to post.\\n7-7. On the command Open Ranks, MARCH; Backward, MARCH; Right (Left) Step, MARCH;\\nForward, MARCH and on commands that cause the platoon to change interval in line, they move at the\\nsame time (with the appropriate step) so as to maintain proper position.\\n7-8. The leader of the first squad serves as the base when the platoon is in a line formation. The leader of\\nthe fourth squad serves as the base when the platoon is in a column formation.\\n7-9. If for some reason the platoon is authorized a guidon or phase banner (in training units, for example),\\nthe bearer\u2019s post is one step in front of and two 15-inch steps to the right of and facing the person forming\\nthe platoon. When the formation is faced to the right for a marching movement, they execute in the same\\nmanner as explained in appendix G, except that their post is three steps in front of and centered on the squad\\nleaders. If the platoon leader is present and at their post, the bearer\u2019s post is one step to the rear and two\\n15-inch steps to the left of the platoon leader.\\n7-10. When the platoon drills as a separate unit, in a line formation, the post for the platoon leader is six\\nsteps in front of and centered on the platoon; when in a column formation, the platoon leader is six steps to\\nthe left flank and centered on the platoon. When marching as part of a larger formation, their post is one step\\nin front of and centered on the squad leaders.\\n7-11. When the platoon leader commands Open Ranks, MARCH; Backward, MARCH; Right (Left) Step,\\nMARCH; Forward, MARCH or causes the platoon to change interval, they move at the same time (with\\nthe appropriate step) so as to maintain proper position:\\n\\uf06c When assuming their post in column from a line formation, the platoon leader faces to the right in\\nmarching (on the command of execution FACE) and marches in the most direct route to their post,\\nhalts, and faces to the left.\\n\\uf06c When assuming their post in line from a column formation, the platoon leader faces to the left in\\nmarching (on the command of execution FACE) and marches in the most direct route to their post,\\nhalts perpendicular to the formation, and faces to the right.\\nFORMING THE PLATOON\\n7-12. The platoon normally forms in a line formation; however, it may re-form in a column when each\\nSoldier can identify their exact position (equipment grounded) in the formation.\\n7-13. The platoon forms basically the same as a squad. The platoon sergeant assumes the Position of\\nAttention and commands FALL IN (At Close Interval, FALL IN or In Column, FALL IN). On the\\ncommand FALL IN (At Close Interval, FALL IN), the squad leader and the first squad (when formed) are\\n7-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\nthree steps in front of and centered on the platoon sergeant. Other squad leaders cover on the first squad\\nleader at the correct distance, which is obtained by estimation. The members of the first squad fall in on their\\nsquad leader as prescribed for squad drill. Members of the other squads fall in on their squad leader, assume\\nthe Position of Attention, and turn their heads and eyes to the right. They obtain correct distance by taking\\nshort steps forward or backward and align themselves on the Soldier to their right. They then sharply turn\\ntheir heads and eyes to the front as in the Position of Attention and obtain proper interval by taking short\\nsteps left and right to cover on the Soldier to their front. Members of all squads, other than the first squad,\\nwill not raise their left arms unless the Soldier to their immediate left has no one to their front in the formation\\non which to cover.\\n7-14. When armed, members fall in at Order Arms or Sling Arms. For safety, the commands Inspection,\\nARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS are given at the initial formation of the day and just\\nbefore the last command, DISMISSED.\\n7-15. When a report is appropriate, the platoon sergeant commands REPORT. The squad leaders, in\\nsuccession from front to rear, turn their heads and eyes toward the platoon sergeant and salute (holding the\\nSalute until returned) and report. The squad leaders do not state the unit. For example\u2014\\n\\uf06c Situation 1. When all squad members are in formation, the report is \u201cAll present.\u201d\\n\\uf06c Situation 2. When squad members are absent, the Soldiers name and reasons for absence are\\nreported:\\n\\uf0a7 Private Smit\u2014charge of quarter\u2019s runner.\\n\\uf0a7 Private Miller\u2014sick call.\\n\\uf0a7 Private Rodriguez\u2014absent without leave.\\n7-16. Platoon sergeants turn their head and eyes toward the reporting squad leader, receive the report, and\\nreturn the salute. After receiving the report from the squad leaders, the platoon sergeant faces about and\\nawaits the arrival of the platoon leader or a directive from the first sergeant to REPORT. When the platoon\\nleader has halted at their post, the platoon sergeant salutes and reports, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, All present,\u201d or \u201cSir\\nor Ma\u2019am, All accounted for,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, (so many) Soldiers are absent.\u201d The platoon leader returns\\nthe Salute. After the Salute has been returned, the platoon sergeant faces to the right in marching, inclines\\naround the squad leaders, halts at their post, and faces to the right. If reporting to the first sergeant, the platoon\\nsergeant turns their head and eyes toward the first sergeant, salutes, and reports.\\n7-17. If the platoon leader is not present for the formation, and the commander is in charge of the formation,\\nthe platoon sergeant steps forward three steps to be a total of six steps and centered on their platoon (after\\nreceiving the squad leader\u2019s report) and, on the command POST, assumes the duties of the platoon leader.\\n7-18. When appropriate, the platoon may be formed by the platoon leader rather than by the platoon sergeant.\\nThe procedures are the same as previously described in paragraph 7-17 except that the first squad forms six\\nsteps in front of and centered on the platoon leader, and the platoon sergeant forms at their post to the rear of\\nthe platoon. For continuity purposes in this chapter, \u201cplatoon sergeant\u201d may also denote \u201cplatoon leader\u201d\\nwhen the platoon leader is executing drill from their post.\\nBREAKING RANKS\\n7-19. When the situation requires, the platoon sergeant directs: \u201cPrivate Rodriguez (pause), front and\\ncenter;\u201d or \u201cThe following personnel front and center\u2014Private Rodriguez (pause), Private Miller.\u201d When\\nthe individual\u2019s name is called, they assume the Position of Attention and reply, \u201cHere, Sergeant (Sir or\\nMa\u2019am).\u201d They then take one (15-inch) step backward, halt, face to the right (left) in marching, and exit the\\nformation by marching to the nearest flank. The Soldier does not look left or right. Once the individual has\\ncleared the formation, they begin to double-time and halt two steps in front of and centered on the platoon\\nsergeant.\\nNote. When a group of individuals are called from the formation, the group forms centered on the\\nplatoon sergeant. The platoon sergeant should direct (point) the first Soldier into position so that\\nthe rank will be centered when the last Soldier has joined the group.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-5Chapter 7\\nCOUNTING OFF\\n7-20. The platoon counts off in the same manner as the squad. When in a line formation, the squads count in\\nunison from right to left; each squad leader sounds off, \u201cONE.\u201d When in a column formation, the Soldiers\\nabreast of each other count in unison from front to rear; each squad leader sounds off, \u201cONE.\u201d\\nCHANGING INTERVAL\\n7-21. The platoon changes interval in a line formation in the same manner as the squad. To change interval\\nwhen the platoon is in a column at the Halt, the right file stands fast and serves as the base. All other members\\n(abreast of each other) execute the movement as previously described in paragraph 6-10. To obtain\\nClose Interval from Normal Interval, the third squad takes one right step, the second squad takes two right\\nsteps, and the first squad takes three right steps. To obtain Normal Interval, the procedures are the same\\nexcept that the squads execute the same number of left steps.\\n7-22. To change interval when the platoon is marching in a column, the preparatory command Close Interval\\nis given as the right foot strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution MARCH is given the\\nnext time the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the base squad\\n(right file) takes one more 30-inch step and then executes the Half Step. All other Soldiers take one more\\nstep, simultaneously execute a Column Half Right, and march until Close Interval is obtained. They execute\\na Column Half Left and assume the Half Step when abreast of the corresponding Soldier of the base squad.\\nOn the command Forward, MARCH, all Soldiers resume marching with a 30-inch step. The commands\\nMark Time, MARCH and Platoon, HALT may also be given.\\n7-23. To resume marching at Normal Interval, the preparatory command Normal Interval is given as the left\\nfoot strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution MARCH is given the next time the left\\nfoot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon members obtain\\nNormal Interval in the same manner prescribed for Close Interval except that they each execute Column Half\\nLeft and then Column Half Right.\\n7-24. To obtain Double Interval from Normal Interval, the procedures are the same as from Close Interval\\nto Normal Interval.\\n7-25. To obtain Normal Interval from Double Interval (closing the formation in column from Open Ranks),\\nthe procedures are the same as obtaining Close Interval from Normal Interval.\\nALIGNING THE PLATOON\\n7-26. The platoon is aligned similar to the squad. On the command of execution DRESS, the first squad\\nleader stands fast and serves as the base. Other squad leaders obtain correct distance by estimation. The\\nmembers of the first squad execute in the same manner as in squad drill to obtain exact interval. All other\\nsquads execute as the first squad, except that each squad member raises the left arm only for uniformity,\\ncovering (glancing out the corner of the left eye) on the Soldier to the front.\\n7-27. If the platoon sergeant wants exact alignment, they face to the Half Left (Half Right) in marching and\\nmarch (on the command of execution DRESS) by the most direct route to a position on line with the first\\nsquad, halt one step from the squad leader or left flank Soldier, and face down the line. From this position,\\nthey verify the alignment of the first squad, directing the Soldier to move forward or backward, as necessary,\\ncalling them by name or number: \u201cPrivate Smit, forward 2 inches; Number eight, backward 4 inches.\u201d The\\nplatoon sergeant remains at Attention, taking short steps to the right or left as necessary, to see down the\\nsquad:\\n\\uf06c Having aligned the first squad, the platoon sergeant, after centering themselves on the first squad,\\nfaces to the Left (Right) in marching, taking two (three if at open ranks) short steps to the next\\nsquad, halts, faces down the line, and aligns the squad in the same manner.\\n\\uf06c After the last squad is aligned, the platoon sergeant centers themselves on the squad leader by\\ntaking short steps left or right, faces to the Right (Left) in marching, returns to their position\\n(centered on the platoon), halts perpendicular to the formation, faces to the Left (Right), and\\ncommands Ready, FRONT.\\n7-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\nNote. When the platoon dresses as part of a larger formation, all squad leaders turn their heads and\\neyes to their right and align themselves on the unit to their right. The platoon sergeant aligns the\\nplatoon from the left flank rather than from the right flank when their platoon is not formed as the\\nright flank platoon.\\n7-28. To align the platoon in column, the commands are COVER and RE-COVER. On the command\\nCOVER, the fourth squad leader stands fast and serves as base. The squad leaders, except for the left flank\\nsquad leader, raise their arms laterally and turn their heads and eyes to the right. The members of the fourth\\nsquad raise their left arms horizontally (as in squad drill) to the front and cover the Soldier to their front at\\ncorrect distance (one arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches). Squad members of the third, second, and first squads raise\\ntheir left arms horizontally to the front (for uniformity only), cover on the Soldier to their front, and, at the\\nsame time, glance out of the corner of their right eyes aligning on the Soldiers to their right. To resume the\\nPosition of Attention, the command is RE-COVER. On this command, each Soldier sharply returns to the\\nPosition of Attention.\\nNote. When the platoon is aligned in column as part of a larger unit but is not the lead platoon, the\\nsquad leaders do not raise their arms or turn their heads and eyes but cover on the squad to their\\nfront. The platoon sergeant must wait until the platoon to their front has been given the command\\nRE-COVER before giving the command COVER. If the platoon leader is at their post, they must\\nwait until the platoon leader of the platoon to their front has commanded RE-COVER before they\\nface about and give the command COVER.\\nOPENING AND CLOSING RANKS\\n7-29. Open Ranks, MARCH is executed from a line formation while at the halt. It may be executed while\\nat any of the prescribed intervals. The command for this movement is Open Ranks, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the front rank takes two steps forward, the second rank takes one step\\nforward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes two 15-inch steps backward. If additional ranks\\nare present, the fifth rank takes four steps backward, and the sixth rank takes six steps backward.\\nNote. After taking the prescribed steps, the Soldiers do not raise their arms. If the platoon sergeant\\nwants exact interval or alignment, they command At Close Interval (At Double Interval), Dress\\nRight, DRESS. If the platoon is to align on an element to the right, the squad leaders turn their\\nheads and eyes to the right and align themselves with that element.\\n7-30. To Close Ranks, the command is Close Ranks, MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH,\\nthe first rank takes four steps backward, the second rank takes two steps backward, the third rank stands fast,\\nand the fourth rank takes one step forward. On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon leader and\\nplatoon sergeant take the appropriate number of steps to maintain their posts.\\nRESTING THE PLATOON\\n7-31. The platoon rests in the same manner prescribed previously in paragraphs 4-6 and 5-4. The platoon\\nsergeant places the platoon at the Position of Attention and then into one of the rest positions.\\nDISMISSING THE PLATOON\\n7-32. The procedures for dismissing the platoon are basically the same as prescribed for the squad. If the\\nplatoon sergeant so desires, the squads may be released to the control of the squad leaders. The platoon\\nsergeant commands TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SQUADS, and Salutes are exchanged. The platoon\\nsergeant is no longer part of the formation.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-7Chapter 7\\nNote. Without leaving their positions, the squad leaders turn their heads and eyes over the left\\nshoulder and command FALL OUT. The squad leaders move to a position in the immediate area,\\nand command FALL IN. Then, they carry out the previous instructions and/or give any\\ninstructions for actions before the next duty formation.\\n7-33. At times the platoon sergeant may want to turn the formation over to a subordinate; for example, to\\nhave the subordinate march the platoon to a different location:\\n\\uf06c The platoon sergeant calls on an individual and the individual breaks rank (see paragraph 7-3).\\nThe designated Soldier posts two steps from and facing the platoon sergeant. The platoon sergeant\\npasses on any additional instructions and Salutes are exchanged. After exchanging Salutes, the\\nplatoon sergeant moves to a position where they can observe, or they may resume their post at the\\nrear of the formation.\\n\\uf06c The subordinate steps forward two steps and assumes the post of the platoon sergeant. The platoon\\nsergeant is no longer part of the formation; however, they may march alongside of, or behind, the\\nformation to make any corrections or to give further guidance, if necessary.\\n7-34. If the platoon leader is at their post, they command PLATOON SERGEANT. The platoon sergeant\\nfaces to the left in marching and inclines around the squad leaders\u2019 left flank, halts three steps in front of and\\ncentered on the platoon and faces to the right. The platoon leader then commands TAKE CHARGE OF\\nTHE PLATOON, and Salutes are exchanged. The platoon leader is no longer part of the formation. The\\nplatoon sergeant remains at their post, faces about, and carries out the platoon leader\u2019s instructions.\\nSECTION II \u2013 MOVEMENTS\\n7-35. The platoon marches in the same manner prescribed for the squad. When the platoon is marching in a\\nline, the first squad leader serves as the guide, and when the platoon is marching in a column, the fourth\\nsquad leader serves as the guide. When marching in line, each member of each squad (glancing out of the\\ncorner of their right eye) maintains alignment on the Soldier to their right. When marching in column, each\\nmember of the first, second, and third squads maintains alignment on the Soldier to their right.\\nEYES RIGHT\\n7-36. The platoon renders courtesy during ceremonies or when marching past the Colors by executing Eyes\\nRight. The commands for this movement are Eyes, RIGHT and Ready, FRONT.\\n7-37. At the Halt, all Soldiers (on the command of execution, RIGHT), while keeping their shoulders\\nparallel to the front, turn their heads and eyes to the right at a 45-degree angle. They focus on and follow the\\nperson passing to the front until they are again looking forward, at which time their heads and eyes remain\\nfixed to the front. Only the platoon leader renders the Hand Salute.\\n7-38. When marching, the preparatory command Eyes is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface\\nand the command of execution RIGHT is given the next time the right foot strikes the marching surface. On\\nthe command of execution RIGHT, all Soldiers, except the right file, turn their heads and eyes to the right\\nand align themselves on the right file while continuing to march. Soldiers in the right file do not turn their\\nheads and eyes but continue looking straight to the front and maintain correct distance. Only the platoon\\nleader salutes. To terminate the courtesy, the preparatory command Ready is given as the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface, and the command of execution FRONT is given the next time the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. On the command of execution, the Soldiers turn their heads and eyes sharply to the front\\nand the platoon leader terminates the Hand Salute.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF A COLUMN\\n7-39. The platoon changes the direction of marching basically the same as the squad. During a column\\nmovement, the base element is the squad on the flank in the direction of the turn.\\n7-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n7-40. To change the direction 90 degrees, the command is Column Right (Left), MARCH. On the command\\nof execution MARCH, the base squad executes the movement as in squad drill except that the squad leader\\ntakes one 30-inch step and then takes up the Half Step. The squad leader continues marching with the Half\\nStep until the other squad leaders come abreast. The other squad leaders, while maintaining correct (offset)\\ninterval, execute a 45-degree pivot and continue marching in an arc. As they come on line (abreast) with the\\nbase squad leader, they take up the Half Step. When all squad leaders are abreast, they step off with a 30-inch\\nstep without command. All other platoon members march forward on the command of execution and execute\\nthe column movement at approximately the same location as their squad leaders and in the same manner.\\nNote. When the platoon sergeant is marching their platoon as a separate unit or when the company\\nis marching without officers in charge, the platoon sergeant stays centered on the platoon. When\\nthe platoon leader and platoon sergeant are marching at their post in column as part of a larger\\nformation, they execute a Column Half Right (Left) rather than a 90-degree column movement.\\nAfter executing the Column Half Right (Left), they continue marching in an arc, incline as\\nnecessary, and resume their correct positions. After sensing that the squad leaders are abreast of\\neach other, the platoon leader resumes the 30-inch step. At times, the platoon leader may find it\\nnecessary to shorten or lengthen their step to maintain correct distance from the unit to the front.\\n7-41. To change the direction 45 degrees, the command is Column Half Right (Left), MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the platoon executes the movement in the same manner as a 90-degree turn\\nexcept that the base squad leader, as well as the other squad leaders, execute a Column Half Right (Left).\\nNote. When executing a column movement at Double Time, elements adjust the length of their\\nsteps so that interval and distance are maintained through and beyond the pivot point.\\n7-42. To march a platoon in the opposite direction, the command Rear, MARCH is given by the platoon\\nsergeant the same way as previously discussed in paragraphs 4-20 and 6-26. The platoon marches in the\\nopposite direction (Rear, MARCH) in the same manner as the squad.\\n7-43. The platoon inclines in the same manner as the squad discussed in paragraph 6-24. The squad nearest\\nthe direction of the turn serves as the base. To avoid an obstacle in the path of the march, the platoon leader\\ndirects INCLINE AROUND LEFT (RIGHT).\\n7-44. When space is limited and the platoon sergeant wants to march their unit in the opposite direction\\n(reverse), with the squad leaders at the head of their squads, they command Counter-Column, MARCH. On\\nthe command of execution MARCH (at the Halt), the first squad marches forward three steps, executes a\\nColumn Right, marches across the front of the platoon, and executes another Column Right just beyond the\\nfourth squad. The second squad steps forward one step, executes a Column Right, marches forward, and\\nexecutes another Column Right between the third and fourth squads. The third squad executes two short\\nColumn Lefts from the Halt and marches between the remainder of the third squad and the second squad. The\\nfourth squad marches forward two steps, executes a Column Left, marches across the front of the platoon,\\nand executes another Column Left between the first and second squads (see figure 7-3 on page 7-10).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-9Chapter 7\\nFigure 7-3. Counter-Column March at the Halt\\n7-45. As the third squad leader marches past the last person in the third squad, they and their squad begin to\\nmarch at the Half Step. After marching past the last Soldier in each file, all other squads incline to the right\\nand left as necessary, obtain Normal Interval on the third squad and begin to march with the Half Step. When\\nall squads are abreast of each other, they begin marching with a 30-inch step without command.\\n7-46. If a guidon or phase banner is present, on the command of execution MARCH of Counter-Column,\\nMARCH the bearer executes a Column Right, marches across the platoon, and executes another Column\\nRight just beyond the fourth squad, and then inclines as necessary to return to the bearers post.\\n7-47. During the movement, without the platoon leader present, the platoon sergeant marches alongside the\\nfirst squad. With the platoon leader present, the platoon sergeant marches one step to the rear and centered\\nbetween the second and third squads (see figure 7-2 on page 7-3) and the platoon leader marches alongside\\nthe first squad.\\n7-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n7-48. When marching, the preparatory command Counter-Column is given as the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface and the command of execution MARCH is given the next time the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon executes the movement basically the\\nsame as from the Halt, except that the squad takes one additional step to ensure that the pivot foot is in the\\ncorrect position to execute the movement.\\nNotes. 1. When there are only three squads in the column, the first squad takes two steps before\\nexecuting.\\n2. When the platoon leader and platoon sergeant are marching at their posts as part of a larger\\nformation, the platoon leader takes three steps forward and executes a column right, marches\\nacross the front of the platoon, executes another column right (just beyond fourth squad), marches\\nto their post in the most direct manner, takes up the Half Step, and then steps off with a 30-inch\\nstep when the squad leaders come on line. The platoon sergeant inclines to the right, follows the\\nthird squad until the movement is completed, and then resumes their post.\\nMARCHING TO THE FLANKS\\n7-49. The platoon may be marched to the flank (for short distances only) when marching in column. The\\ncommand for this movement is Right (Left) Flank, MARCH. The preparatory command is given as the foot\\nin the desired direction strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution is given the next time\\nthe foot in the desired direction strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, all\\nmembers take one more step, pivot 90 degrees in the commanded direction on the ball of the lead foot, and\\nstep off in the new direction with the trailing foot. As the members begin to march in the new direction, they\\nglance out of the corner of their right eyes and dress to the right.\\nFORMING A FILE AND RE-FORMING\\n7-50. The platoon forms a single file, from the right, left, or as designated, only when in column and at the\\nHalt. The commands are File from the left (right), MARCH or File in sequence three-two-four-one,\\nMARCH.\\nNote. If the squad\u2019s direction of travel is to the left, or the squad is immediately following an\\nelement on the left, then all supplementary commands will be given over the left shoulder. If the\\nsquad\u2019s direction of travel is forward or to the right, or is immediately following a squad on the\\nright, all supplementary commands will be given over the right shoulder. The squad leaders give\\nthe appropriate command so that they are following the last Soldier in the preceding squad at the\\ncorrect distance.\\n7-51. On the preparatory command, the squad leader of the designated squad gives the supplementary\\ncommand Forward. The other squad leaders command STAND FAST. On the command of execution\\nMARCH (given by the platoon sergeant), the lead squad marches forward. The squad leader next to the lead\\nelement (or as designated) looks over the shoulder nearest the moving element and commands Column Half\\nLeft (Right) when the second from the last Soldier is abreast of them and their right foot strikes the marching\\nsurface. The squad leader gives the command of execution MARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier\\nstrikes the marching surface when abreast of them. On the command of execution, the squad leader executes\\nthe Column Half Left (Right), then inclines without command to the right (left) and follows the last Soldier\\nof the preceding squad at correct distance. Other members of the squad march forward and execute the same\\nmovements as the squad leader. The remaining squads form the file in the same manner as the squad\\nimmediately behind the lead element.\\n7-52. The platoon may form a file and execute a column movement simultaneously from a column formation.\\nThe command for this movement is File from the left (right), Column Left (Right), MARCH. Following\\nthe platoon sergeant\u2019s preparatory command, the squad leader of the lead element commands Column Left\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-11Chapter 7\\n(Right), instead of Forward. The other squad leaders command STAND FAST. On the platoon leader\u2019s\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the lead squad executes the Column Left (Right). The other squad leaders\\ncommand Column Left (Right) (when the second from the last person is abreast of them) and then gives the\\ncommand of execution MARCH as the right foot of the last person strikes the marching surface abreast of\\nthem.\\nNotes. 1. At this point, the platoon is executing platoon drill. The platoon sergeant will not release\\ncontrol of the squads to the squad leaders. The platoon sergeant will rest personnel on an as needed\\nbasis; for example, when filing into a building.\\n2.The squad leaders give the command of execution MARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier\\nstrikes the marching surface at the pivot (Column Left), or the first time the last Soldier\u2019s right\\nfoot strikes the marching surface after the pivot (Column Right).\\n7-53. The platoon re-forms to the original column formation only from the Halt. The command is Column\\nof fours to the right (left), MARCH:\\nNote. To re-form the platoon to its original column formation when the file was formed on the\\ncommand In Sequence, MARCH, the commands FALL OUT and FALL IN must be given.\\n\\uf06c On the preparatory command, the squad leader of the base squad commands STAND FAST. All\\nother squad leaders command Column Half Right (Left). On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of\\nexecution MARCH, the base squad stands fast; all other squads execute the Column Half Right\\n(Left) simultaneously.\\n\\uf06c As each of the moving squad leaders reach a point (line) that ensures correct interval on the\\nelement to their left (right), they automatically incline to the left (right) and command Mark Time,\\nMARCH and Squad, HALT so that their squad is abreast of the base (other) squad when halted.\\nFORMING A COLUMN OF TWOS AND RE-FORMING\\n7-54. The platoon forms a column of twos from the right or left when in a column of fours at the Halt. The\\ncommand is Column of twos from the left (right), MARCH:\\n\\uf06c On the preparatory command, the squad leaders of the two lead squads command Forward. The\\nother squad leaders command STAND FAST:\\n\\uf0a7 On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of execution MARCH, the two lead squads march\\nforward. The squad leader (second or third) next to the lead element gives the command to\\nstart both remaining squads in motion. Looking over the shoulder nearest the moving\\nelements, the squad leader gives the preparatory command Column Half Left (Right) (when\\nthe second from the last Soldier is abreast of them) and then gives the command of execution\\nMARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier strikes the marching surface abreast of them.\\n\\uf0a7 On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of execution, both squad leaders execute the Column\\nHalf Left (Right), incline to the right (left) without command, and follow the last Soldiers of\\nthe preceding squads at correct distance (do not close the space if the files of the two leading\\nsquads are uneven). Other members of the remaining squads march forward and execute the\\nsame movements as their squad leaders.\\n\\uf06c The platoon may form a column of twos and execute a column movement simultaneously from a\\ncolumn formation. The command for this movement is Column of twos from the left (right),\\nColumn left (right), MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 The squad leaders of the lead squads command Column Left (Right) instead of Forward. The\\nsquad leader of the second (third) squad gives the command Column Left (Right); however,\\nthey execute Column Half Left (Right). The remaining two squad leaders command STAND\\nFAST.\\n7-12 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n\\uf0a7 On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of execution MARCH, the lead squads execute the\\nColumn Left (Right). The squad leader (second or third) next to the lead elements gives the\\ncommand to start both squads in motion. Looking over the shoulder nearest the moving\\nelements, the squad leader gives the preparatory command Column Left (Right) when the\\nsecond from the last Soldier is abreast of them. Then they give the command of execution\\nMARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier strikes the marching surface at the pivot (Column\\nLeft) or the first time the last Soldier\u2019s right foot strikes the marching surface after the pivot\\n(Column Right). Although the command is Column Left (Right), the outside squads (fourth\\nor first) execute Column Half Left (Right).\\n\\uf06c The platoon re-forms to the original column formation only from the Halt. The command is\\nColumn of fours to the right (left), MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 When re-forming into a column of fours without the platoon leader present, the platoon\\nsergeant remains at their post centered on the platoon. When re-forming into a column of\\nfours with the platoon leader present, the platoon leader faces as in marching and resumes\\ntheir original position in the column. The platoon sergeant follows the rear element and\\nresumes their post in the formation when the element has halted.\\n\\uf0a7 On the preparatory command, the squad leaders of the base squads command STAND FAST.\\nThe trailing squad leaders command Column Half Right (Left). On the platoon sergeant\u2019s\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the base squads stand fast. The trailing squad leaders\\nexecute slightly more than the Column Half Right (Left) simultaneously. As the trailing squad\\nleaders reach a point (line) that will ensure correct interval on the element to their left (right),\\nthey automatically incline to the left (right). The squad leader nearest the stationary squads\\n(second or third) commands Mark Time, MARCH and Squads, HALT.\\nSECTION III \u2013 INSPECTIONS\\n7-55. Inspections at platoon level are typically conducted by the platoon sergeant. If the platoon leader wants\\nto inspect, they conduct the inspection from their post. For continuity purposes, this section will address the\\nplatoon sergeant\u2019s actions only.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n7-56. The platoon has one prescribed formation for inspecting personnel and equipment in ranks\u2014the line\\nformation. When inspecting crew-served weapons and vehicles, the personnel are normally positioned to the\\nrear of the formation with the operator (gunner) standing by their vehicle (weapon). Typically, the platoons\\nare inspected by the platoon sergeants; however, they may be inspected by the first sergeant or company\\ncommander.\\n7-57. The platoon leader or platoon sergeant may conduct an in-quarters (barracks) inspection to include\\npersonal appearance, individual weapons, field equipment, displays, maintenance, and sanitary conditions.\\nThe platoon leader or platoon sergeant will follow local guidelines.\\n7-58. When field equipment is to be inspected, it should be displayed neatly, organized, and serviceable.\\nAdditional equipment or different models of the equipment should be arranged in a uniform manner\\nestablished by the local commander. The squad leaders may carry and use materials to record deficiencies if\\nthe local chain of command authorizes it.\\nIN-RANKS INSPECTION\\n7-59. To conduct in-ranks inspections, put the platoon use the following procedures in a line formation, the\\nplatoon sergeant commands Count, OFF. On the command of execution OFF, all personnel except right\\nflank personnel turn their heads and eyes to the right and the right flank personnel count off with \u201cONE.\u201d\\nAfter the right flank Soldiers have counted their number, the Soldiers to their left count off with the next\\nhigher number and simultaneously turn their heads and eyes to the front. All other members of the formation\\ncount off in the same manner until the entire formation has counted off.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-13Chapter 7\\n7-60. After the platoon has counted off, the platoon sergeant commands Open Ranks, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the front rank takes two steps forward, the second rank takes one step\\nforward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes two steps backward. If additional ranks are\\npresent, the fifth rank takes four steps backward, and the sixth rank takes six steps backward.\\nNote. After taking the prescribed number of steps, the Soldiers do not raise their arms. If the\\nplatoon leader wants exact interval or alignment, they command At Close Interval (At Double\\nInterval), Dress Right, DRESS. (See paragraph 7-28 for more information on aligning the\\nplatoon.)\\n7-61. At this point, the platoon is ready to be inspected. Typically, the squads are inspected by the squad\\nleaders; however they may be inspected by the platoon sergeant or platoon leader.\\nSQUAD LEADERS\u2019 INSPECTION\\n7-62. If the platoon sergeant wants the squad leaders to inspect their squads, they will direct INSPECT\\nYOUR SQUADS. Salutes are not exchanged.\\n7-63. The squad leaders face to the half left as in marching and march by the most direct route to a point\\n15 inches in front of and centered on the first Soldier.\\nNote. If the members of the platoon are armed, the squad leaders will sling their weapons\\ndiagonally across the back with the muzzle down and to the right. This movement will be executed\\nwithout command and prior to the squad leader stepping off.\\n7-64. The squad leaders remain at a modified Position of Attention moving their heads and eyes only. After\\ninspecting at the center position, they take a short step forward and to the left and inspects, return to the center\\nand step forward and to the right and inspect, and return to the center position.\\n7-65. Having inspected the first Soldier, the squad leader faces to the right as in marching and takes one (two\\nif at normal interval) step, halts, and faces the next Soldier at the appropriate distance. The squad leader\\nconducts the inspection for the rest of the Soldiers in the squad.\\n7-66. After inspecting the last Soldier in the squad, the squad leader faces to the right as in marching and\\nmarches around behind the squad, inclining as necessary. While the squad leader marches back to their post,\\nthey inspect the squad from the rear.\\n7-67. After resuming their post, the squad leader turns their head and eyes over their left shoulder and\\ncommands their squad to assume At Ease. The platoon sergeant remains at their post (inspects the guidon or\\nphase bearer as appropriate). After the last squad has been inspected and is at At Ease, the platoon sergeant\\ncommands the platoon to Attention.\\n7-68. After commanding the platoon to Attention, the platoon sergeant commands Close Ranks, MARCH.\\nOn the command of execution MARCH, the first rank takes four steps backward, the second rank takes two\\nsteps backward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes one step forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant take the appropriate number of steps to maintain\\ntheir posts.\\n7-69. If the platoon is being inspected as part of a larger formation and control of the platoon has not been\\nturned over to the platoon sergeant, they face about, and execute At Ease. They then wait on further\\ninstructions from the first sergeant.\\nPLATOON SERGEANT\u2019S OR PLATOON LEADER\u2019S INSPECTION\\n7-70. If the platoon sergeant is not going to inspect the entire platoon, they direct the squad leaders of the\\nappropriate squads to inspect their squads. All others will be inspected by the platoon sergeant. When armed,\\nthe platoon sergeant slings their weapon in the same manner as the squad leaders.\\n7-14 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n7-71. The platoon sergeant faces to the Half Left as in marching and marches by the most direct route to a\\npoint 15 inches in front of and centered on the first squad leader (or the squad leader of the squad to be\\ninspected). As soon as the platoon sergeant halts in front of the squad leader, they command the other squads\\nto At Ease and inspect the squad leader.\\n7-72. The platoon sergeant remains at a modified Position of Attention moving their head and eyes only.\\nAfter inspecting at the center position, they take a short step forward and to the left and inspect, return to the\\ncenter and step forward and to the right and inspect, and return to the center position.\\n7-73. Having inspected the squad leader, the platoon sergeant faces to the right as in marching and takes one\\n(two if at normal interval) steps, halts, and faces the next Soldier at the appropriate distance. After the platoon\\nsergeant steps off, the squad leader takes a half step forward and faces about. When moving from Soldier to\\nSoldier, the squad leader and platoon sergeant move simultaneously.\\n7-74. Having inspected the last Soldier in the squad, the platoon sergeant faces to the right as in marching\\nand marches around behind the squad, inclining as necessary. The platoon sergeant inspects the squad from\\nthe rear.\\n7-75. As the platoon sergeant begins to inspect the first squad from the rear, the second squad leader\\ncommands their squad to Attention. The first squad leader returns to their post. After the platoon sergeant\\narrives in front of the second squad leader, the platoon sergeant commands the first squad to At Ease over\\ntheir right shoulder. All remaining squads will be inspected in the same manner as the first.\\n7-76. The platoon sergeant and squad leader execute in the same manner as in inspecting the first squad until\\nthe entire platoon has been inspected. After inspecting the rear of the last squad, the platoon sergeant marches\\nby the most direct route to their post, halts, faces to the left and commands the platoon to Attention.\\n7-77. After commanding the platoon to Attention, the platoon sergeant commands Close Ranks, MARCH.\\nOn the command of execution MARCH, the first rank takes four steps backward, the second rank takes two\\nsteps backward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes one step forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant take the appropriate number of steps to maintain\\ntheir posts.\\n7-78. If the platoon is being inspected as part of a larger formation and control of the platoon has been not\\nbeen turned over to the platoon sergeant, they face about and execute At Ease. They then await further\\ninstructions from the first sergeant.\\nIN-QUARTERS (STAND BY) INSPECTION\\n7-79. When the platoon sergeant wants to conduct an in-quarters inspection, they position the squad members\\non line with their equipment or as near it as possible. The squad leader positions themselves in the path of\\nthe inspector at a point near their area of responsibility. At the approach of the inspector, the squad leader\\ncommands, Squad, ATTENTION and reports, \u201cSergeant, the platoon is prepared for inspection.\u201d\\nNote. When the situation dictates, the squad leader may report to the inspector outside of the\\nquarters. A designated individual commands the members to ATTENTION as the inspector\\nenters the area.\\n7-80. The squad leader then guides the inspector along a route dictated by the physical arrangement of the\\npersonnel and equipment. Upon entering the area, the highest ranking Soldier present commands AT EASE.\\nAs the inspector approaches each individual or their equipment, the individual automatically assumes the\\nPosition of Attention. When the inspector has moved to the next Soldier, the last Soldier inspected resumes\\nthe position of At Ease. As the inspector begins to exit the area after completing the inspection, CARRY ON\\nis commanded.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-15Chapter 7\\nNote. When inspecting Soldiers\u2019 rooms, Attention is not commanded. The individuals\\nautomatically assume the Position of Attention as the inspector enters the room. The inspector then\\ncommands AT EASE. As the inspector approaches each Soldier, the Soldier assumes the Position\\nof Attention and resumes At Ease after they have been inspected.\\n7-16 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 8\\nCompany Drill\\n\u201cThe fundamentals of drill are established daily.... If these maneuvers are all\\naccurately observed and practiced every day then the army will remain virtually\\nundefeatable and always awe inspiring\u2026.\u201d\\nFrederick the Great: \u201cHistory of My Own Times,\u201d\\ntranslated to English in 1789\\nSECTION I \u2013 PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL\\n8-1. The procedures used and personnel required to conduct company drill are described in this section.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n8-2. The following bullets discuss basic information that applies to conducting company drill:\\n\\uf06c Individual drill movements, manual of arms, and squad and platoon drills are executed as\\npreviously described in chapters 4 through 7 while conducting company drill.\\n\\uf06c For the most part, company drill provides the procedures for executing platoon drill in conjunction\\nwith other platoons in the same formation.\\n\\uf06c For drill purposes, a company consists of a company headquarters and two or more platoons. The\\ncompany headquarters personnel are attached to the platoons to equalize platoon strength without\\ninterfering with the permanent squad organization; however, the commander may form the\\nheadquarters personnel into a separate platoon at either flank of the company. When headquarters\\npersonnel form as a separate element, the senior sergeant serves as the platoon sergeant, and the\\ncompany executive officer serves as the platoon leader.\\n\\uf06c When in a line or a mass formation, the right platoon serves as the base; when in a column\\nformation, the lead platoon serves as the base.\\n\\uf06c The company may be formed by the commander and the platoon leaders or the first sergeant and\\nthe platoon sergeants. If the commander is not scheduled to receive or inspect the company, the\\nfirst sergeant and platoon sergeants remain at their posts and execute company drill from their\\nposts. For continuity purposes, the term \u201cfirst sergeant\u201d may be used to denote \u201ccommander,\u201d just\\nas \u201cplatoon sergeant\u201d may be used to denote \u201cplatoon leader\u201d when the first sergeant and platoon\\nsergeants are conducting company drill from their posts.\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant directs that the company open or close ranks, align, stack or take arms,\\nextend march, close on the leading platoon, or prepare for inspection, the movements are executed\\non the command of the platoon sergeants and not on the directives of the first sergeant. The platoon\\nsergeants command the movement in sequence beginning with the base platoon.\\n\\uf06c During all drills and ceremonies, the first sergeant and executive officer carry their weapons at\\nSling Arms. They remain at Sling Arms during all manual of arms movements except when they\\nexecute the Hand Salute while at Sling Arms.\\n\\uf06c The members of a company break ranks in the same manner as in platoon drill except that the\\nindividuals called from the formation form on the first sergeant rather than on the platoon sergeant.\\n\\uf06c The company marches, rests, and executes Eyes Right in the same manner as the platoon.\\n\\uf06c The company has four prescribed formations: company in line with platoons in line; company in\\ncolumn with platoons in column; company in column with platoons in line (used primarily for\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-1Chapter 8\\nceremonies); and company mass formation. However, the company may be formed into a column\\nof twos in the same manner as the platoon.\\nPOSTS FOR KEY PERSONNEL\\n8-3. Key personnel assume their posts as follows:\\n\\uf06c Company commander. The company commander\u2019s post is normally 12 steps in front of the front\\nrank of troops and centered on the company as seen in figure 8-1. The only exceptions to this rule\\nare when the company forms as part of a larger unit in a column formation (with the company and\\nplatoons in column) or when the company is formed in a mass formation. In these situations, the\\ncompany commander\u2019s post is 6 steps in front of and centered on the front rank of troops and 12\\nsteps behind the last rank of troops of the element to their front as seen in figure 8-2 on page 8-5.\\n\\uf06c Guidon bearer. The guidon bearer\u2019s post is two 15-inch steps to the rear and two 15-inch steps to\\nthe left of the company commander (see figure 8-1). (The manual of the guidon is discussed in\\nfurther detail in appendix F.)\\n8-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFigure 8-1. Company in line with platoons in line\\nNote. The company commander should inconspicuously direct the guidon bearer to remain in\\nposition and move with the commander when the company is to be faced to the right and marched\\nfor only a short distance.\\n\\uf06c Executive officer. When the company is in a line formation, the executive officer\u2019s post is two\\nsteps to the rear of the first sergeant; in a column or a mass formation, they are three steps to the\\nrear of the last rank and off center (one 15-inch step to the right) of the company.\\n\\uf06c Platoon leaders. When the company is in a line formation with the platoons in line, the post for\\nthe platoon leader is six steps in front of and centered on the platoon. When the company is in\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-3Chapter 8\\ncolumn formation with the platoons in column or the company is in column with the platoons in\\nline, the post for the platoon leader is one step in front of and centered on the platoon. When the\\ncompany is in mass formation, the post for the platoon leaders is one step in front of and evenly\\nspaced across the company front. If the commander is not present, the platoon leaders are not part\\nof the formation.\\n\\uf06c First sergeant. When the company is in a line formation, the first sergeant\u2019s post is three steps to\\nthe rear of the last rank and centered on the company; in a column or a mass formation, they are\\nthree steps to the rear of the last rank and off center (one 15-inch step to the left) of the company\\n(see figure 8-2):\\n\\uf0a7 When the company is in mass formation, without the commander present, the post for the first\\nsergeant is five steps in front of and centered on the formation. When the company is in a line\\nformation with the platoons in a line without the commander present, the post for the first\\nsergeant is nine steps in front of and centered on the company. When the company is in a\\ncolumn formation with the platoons in a column without the commander present, the post for\\nthe first sergeant is nine steps to the left flank of and centered on the company.\\n\\uf0a7 When marching the company in mass formation with the commander at their post, the first\\nsergeant remains at their post to provide cadence and control.\\n\\uf06c Platoon sergeant. When the company is in any of the four formations and the officers are present,\\nthe platoon sergeant\u2019s post is one step to the rear and centered on their platoon:\\n\\uf0a7 When the company is in mass formation, the post for the platoon sergeants is one step to the\\nrear of the company and evenly spaced across the frontage. When the company is in mass\\nformation, Without the Officers Present, the post for the platoon sergeants is one step in front\\nof and evenly spaced across the front.\\n\\uf0a7 When the company is in a line formation with the platoons in a line Without the Officers\\nPresent, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps in front of and centered on their\\nplatoon. When the company is in column formation with the platoons in column Without the\\nOfficers Present, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps to the left flank of and centered\\non their platoon.\\n\\uf0a7 When marching the company Without the Officers Present, and the company is in column\\nformation with the platoons in column, the platoon sergeants remain at their posts and provide\\nfor cadence and control of their platoons.\\n\\uf06c Additional officers. Other officers assigned or attached, who have no prescribed position within\\nthe formation, form evenly to the right and left of the executive officer in a line formation; they\\nfall out and form in one or two ranks at correct distance to the rear of the first sergeant and\\nexecutive officer when the company forms in column (see figure 8-4 on page 8-7).\\n8-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFigure 8-2. Company in column with platoons in column\\n8-4. The executive officer inconspicuously gives the necessary commands (March, Column Half Left, Halt,\\nand Facings) for themselves and the first sergeant when changing from one post to another. Once in motion,\\nthey incline as necessary and march to their new posts. When the company changes from a line formation to\\na column formation, the first sergeant and executive officer face with the company but do not march forward.\\nThey remain in position until the last platoon has passed. If the company marches forward (column formation)\\nfor a short distance only, or if it closes on the base platoon (line formation) at close interval, the first sergeant\\nand executive officer march forward or face to the right in marching and resume their posts. When the\\ncompany changes from a column (platoons in column) to a line formation, it faces to the right in marching\\nand assumes the posts in line. When the company forms a company in column with platoons in line, as the\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-5Chapter 8\\nunit is faced, it faces to the right in marching and assumes the posts to the rear of the last platoon. When the\\ncompany is formed in mass, it faces to the right in marching and assumes the posts at the center of the\\ncompany immediately after halting with the last platoon (see figure 8-3). The off-center position explained\\nfor the first sergeant and executive officer should place them at normal interval from each other while\\ncovering a file to their front. If either one is not present during a formation, the one present changes posts\\nwithout command and assumes the post at the center of the company rather than off center (see figure 8-4).\\nFigure 8-3. Company in mass\\n8-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFigure 8-4. Company in column with platoons in line\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-7Chapter 8\\nSECTION II \u2013 FORMATIONS AND MOVEMENTS\\n8-5. This section discusses the formations and movements used in conducting a company drill.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n8-6. This paragraph discusses basic information that applies to the formations and movements used in\\nconducting a company drill:\\n\\uf06c The company normally forms in a line formation; however, it may re-form in column when each\\nSoldier can identify their exact position (equipment grounded) in the formation.\\n\\uf06c The company forms basically the same as the platoon. On the command fall in; (At Close Interval),\\nFALL IN, the platoons form in line, centered on and facing the person forming the unit, with\\nfive-step intervals between platoons.\\nNote. To have the company assemble in a company mass formation, the command is Mass\\nFormation, FALL IN. Before giving the commands, the person forming the unit announces the\\ninterval and the number of personnel in the front and designates the base person. In this situation,\\nthe first sergeant and platoon sergeants travel around the right flank of the formation when moving\\nfrom post to post. The commander and platoon leaders travel around the left flank of the formation\\nwhen moving from post to post.\\n\\uf06c When armed, members fall in at Order (Sling) Arms. For safety, the person forming the unit\\ncommands Inspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS at the initial\\nformation of the day, or when the last command is DISMISSED.\\n\\uf06c The company may be formed by the first sergeant and platoon sergeants or by the company\\ncommander and platoon leaders. When possible, the platoons assemble near the formation site\\nbefore the arrival of the first sergeant or company commander. If the company is formed by the\\nNCOs, the platoon leaders normally observe the procedures from a position to the rear of their\\nplatoons.\\n\\uf06c When the company is formed by the NCOs, the following procedures apply:\\n\\uf0a7 The first sergeant posts themselves nine steps in front of (center) and facing the line where\\nthe front rank of each platoon is to form. They then command fall in; (At Close Interval),\\nFALL IN.\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution, the platoons form in the same manner prescribed in platoon\\ndrill. Each platoon sergeant faces their platoon while the platoons are forming and directs\\ntheir platoon to adjust (if necessary) and align on the platoon to its right at the correct interval\\n(as described in paragraph 8-8). Once the platoon is formed, the platoon sergeants face about.\\nNote. If the command At Close Interval, FALL IN is given, the members of the platoon form at\\nclose interval; however, the five-step interval between platoons is maintained.\\n\\uf0a7 When all platoon sergeants are facing to the front, the first sergeant commands (if appropriate)\\nInspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS. The first sergeant then\\ndirects (if appropriate) RECEIVE THE REPORT. The platoon sergeants face about and\\ncommand REPORT. The squad leaders report (as described in chapter 7). Having received\\nthe report, the platoon sergeants face about. When all platoon sergeants are facing to the front,\\nthe first sergeant commands REPORT. The platoon sergeants turn their heads and eyes\\ntoward the first sergeant, salute and report (as described in chapter 7) in succession from right\\nto left. The first sergeant turns their head and eyes toward the reporting platoon sergeant and\\nreturns each Salute individually. Having received the report from the platoon sergeants, the\\nfirst sergeant faces about and awaits the arrival of the company commander if the commander\\nis scheduled to receive the company.\\n8-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nNote. If the commander is not scheduled to receive or inspect the company, the first sergeant and\\nplatoon sergeants remain at their posts and execute company drill from their posts. For continuity\\npurposes, the term \u201ccommander\u201d may also be used to denote the first sergeant, just as \u201cplatoon\\nleader\u201d may be used to denote the platoon sergeant when the commander and platoon leaders are\\nconducting company drill from their posts.\\n\\uf0a7 When the company commander has halted at their post, the first sergeant salutes and reports,\\n\u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all present,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all accounted for,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, (so\\nmany) Soldiers absent.\u201d The company commander returns the Salute and commands POST.\\nThe first sergeant faces about and marches to their post three steps to the rear and at the center\\nof the company, halts, and faces about. The guidon bearer steps forward three steps. The\\nplatoon sergeants face to the right in marching and assume their posts to the rear of their\\nplatoons (if the platoon leader is not present, they step forward three steps). The platoon\\nleaders march around the left flank of their platoons and assume their posts by inclining facing\\nto the front. The company executive officer assumes their post two steps to the rear of the first\\nsergeant.\\n\\uf06c When the company is formed by the company commander, the procedures are the same as forming\\nwith the NCOs except that the platoon leaders form their platoons and the first sergeant, platoon\\nsergeants, and guidon bearer fall in at their posts (see figure 8-1 on page 8-3). The command\\nPOST is not necessary. If a platoon sergeant is to fill the post of platoon leader, they take a position\\nsix steps in front of and centered on the platoon.\\nCHANGING INTERVAL\\n8-7. The company changes interval in the same manner as prescribed for the platoon:\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant wants the company to obtain close interval in a line formation while\\nmaintaining a five-step interval, they direct CLOSE ON THE BASE PLATOON AT CLOSE\\nINTERVAL. The platoon sergeants face about and command Count, OFF. After the platoons\\nhave counted off, the platoon sergeants command Close Interval, MARCH. The second, third,\\nand fourth platoon sergeants command Right, FACE and in succession command Half Step,\\nMARCH. They halt at the five-step interval and face the platoon to the left. If the directive\\nCLOSE ON THE THIRD PLATOON AT CLOSE INTERVAL is given, the platoon sergeants\\non the right of the designated platoon have their platoons obtain close interval, face their platoons\\nto the left, march (Half Step) forward until the five-step interval is obtained, and then halt and face\\ntheir platoons to the right.\\nNote. When the company is at close interval (line formation), the first sergeant may march the\\ncompany (in column with less than correct distance) at the Half Step for short distances. If the\\nfirst sergeant wants to march with a 30-inch step while marching with less than correct distance,\\nthey command Extend, MARCH. The first platoon sergeant commands Extend, MARCH. The\\nother platoon sergeants command CONTINUE TO MARCH. As the first platoon begins to\\nmarch with a 30-inch step, the second platoon sergeant commands Extend, MARCH. The\\nremaining platoons execute the directive in the same manner as the second platoon.\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant wants the company to obtain normal interval from close interval in a line\\nformation while maintaining a five-step interval, they direct EXTEND ON THE BASE\\nPLATOON AT NORMAL INTERVAL. The platoon sergeants face about and march (Half\\nStep) their platoons to a position that ensures the five-step interval between platoons after they\\nhave obtained normal interval. After halting and facing the platoons to the left, the platoon\\nsergeants command Count, OFF. The platoon sergeants then command Normal Interval,\\nMARCH. If necessary, the platoon sergeant can verify the interval as described in the note of\\nparagraph 8-8.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-9Chapter 8\\nCHANGING DISTANCE\\n8-8. To increase the distance between elements of a company (or larger unit) while marching in column to\\nnormal distance, use the following procedures:\\nNote. This movement is only executed from the half step when a company or larger-size element\\nis marching in column at less than normal distance.\\n\\uf06c To increase the distance between elements of a company (or larger unit) while marching in column\\nat the half step to normal distance, the command is Extend, MARCH. On the preparatory\\ncommand Extend of Extend, MARCH, the platoon sergeant echoes the preparatory command\\nand all subsequent platoon sergeants issue the supplementary command CONTINUE TO\\nMARCH. On the command of execution MARCH of Extend, MARCH, the front rank of the\\nlead element takes one more 15-inch step, then steps off with a 30-inch step. All other ranks\\ncontinue to march with a 15-inch step until the rank to their front has stepped off with a 30-inch\\nstep and has obtained normal distance (40 inches).\\n\\uf06c Subsequent platoon sergeants issue the command Extend, MARCH after the entire element to\\ntheir front has obtained normal distance and has begun marching forward with a 30-inch step.\\nNote. From the Halt, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS EXTEND MARCH.\\nThe lead platoon sergeant gives the command Extend, MARCH. All subsequent platoon sergeants\\ngive the command Half Step, MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH of Extend,\\nMARCH, the front rank steps off with a 30-inch step. All other ranks step off with a 15-inch step\\nand execute the movement in the same manner as previously described in paragraph 8-6.\\nALIGNING THE COMPANY\\n8-9. To align the company, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To align the company in a line formation, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS\\nDRESS RIGHT:\\n\\uf0a7 On the directive, all platoon sergeants face about. The right flank platoon sergeant commands\\nDress Right, DRESS and aligns their platoon as described in platoon drill. When the\\nalignment of the first rank of the right platoon has been verified (the platoon sergeant has\\nstepped off to align the second rank), the platoon sergeant to the left commands Dress Right,\\nDRESS. They then face to the half right in marching, moves to a position on line with and\\none step to the left of the left flank Soldier of the first rank, and face (Left Face) down the\\nline.\\n\\uf0a7 After aligning the first rank, the platoon sergeant centers themselves on the first rank, faces\\nto the right in marching, takes two short steps, halts, executes Left Face, and aligns the second\\nrank. The third and fourth ranks are aligned in the same manner as the second rank.\\n\\uf0a7 After aligning the fourth rank, the platoon sergeant faces to the left in marching; returns to\\ntheir position, center of the platoon; halts perpendicular to the formation; faces to the right;\\ncommands Ready, FRONT; and faces about. All platoon sergeants to the left of the second\\nplatoon take the same actions as the second platoon sergeant.\\nNote. If necessary, the platoon sergeants to the left of the base platoon command VERIFY\\nINTERVAL before commanding Dress Right, DRESS. On the command VERIFY\\nINTERVAL, the base (squad leader of the first squad) faces to the right in marching and moves\\nto the left flank member (first squad) of the platoon to the right, halts, faces about, steps forward\\nfive steps, halts, faces to the right, and aligns themselves on the element to their right.\\n\\uf06c To align the company in column, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS COVER.\\nOn this directive, the first platoon sergeant faces about and commands COVER. The other platoon\\n8-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nsergeants command STAND FAST. The first platoon covers as in platoon drill. The other platoons\\nthen execute the movement in succession as soon as the platoon to their front has completed the\\nmovement.\\nOPENING AND CLOSING RANKS\\n8-10. To Open Ranks, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS OPEN RANKS AND DRESS\\nRIGHT. On the directive, all platoon sergeants face about. The right flank platoon sergeant commands Open\\nRanks, MARCH. When the platoon has completed the movement, they then command Dress Right, DRESS\\nand aligns the platoon the same as in platoon drill. When the first rank of the right platoon has been aligned,\\nthe platoon sergeant to the left commands Open Ranks, MARCH and then commands Dress Right, DRESS.\\nThen they align their platoon in the same manner described in paragraphs 7-28 and 8-8. All platoon sergeants\\nto the left of the second platoon take the same actions as the second platoon sergeant.\\nNote. When clearing grounded equipment, the company may march in column (Right FACE)\\nfrom open ranks (Double Interval) for short distances. Having cleared the equipment, the first\\nsergeant commands Normal Interval, MARCH. When returning to the equipment while marching\\nat normal interval, the command Double Interval, MARCH is given. If the company is marching\\nin reverse order, the commands FALL OUT and FALL IN should be given.\\n8-11. To Close Ranks, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS CLOSE RANKS. On the\\ndirective, all platoon sergeants face about and in sequence from right to left command Close Ranks,\\nMARCH. The platoons execute the movement the same as in platoon drill. After the platoons have completed\\nthe movement, the platoon sergeants face about.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF MARCH OF A COLUMN\\n8-12. To change the direction of march of a column, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c The company changes the direction of march basically the same as the squad and platoon. The\\ncommands are Column Right (Left), Column Half Right (Left), MARCH.\\n\\uf06c The base element during a column movement is the lead platoon and the squad on the flank, in the\\ndirection of turn.\\n\\uf06c When at the Halt, the leading platoon sergeant repeats the first sergeant\u2019s preparatory command.\\nSucceeding platoon sergeants give the supplementary command Forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the leading platoon executes the movement as described in platoon drill;\\nsucceeding platoons execute the movement on their platoon sergeant\u2019s command at approximately\\nthe same location.\\n\\uf06c While marching, the movement is executed as described from the Halt except that the succeeding\\nplatoon sergeants give the supplementary command Continue to March rather than Forward.\\n\\uf06c The company executes Rear March and inclines in the same manner as the platoon.\\n\\uf06c When executing Counter-Column March from the Halt, the leading platoon sergeant repeats the\\npreparatory command. Succeeding platoon sergeants give the supplementary command Forward:\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon executes the movement as\\ndescribed in platoon drill and marches through the other platoons. Succeeding platoons\\nexecute the movement on the platoon sergeant\u2019s command at approximately the same\\nlocation.\\n\\uf0a7 When the movement is executed while marching, the command of execution is given as the\\nleft foot strikes the marching surface. The movement is executed basically the same as from\\nthe Halt except that the succeeding platoon sergeants give the supplementary command\\nContinue to March rather than Forward.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-11Chapter 8\\n\\uf0a7 The guidon bearer faces to the left in marching from the Halt or executes a Column Left in\\nmarching, marches by the most direct route outside of the formation, and repositions\\nthemselves in front of the lead platoon as it clears the rear of the company.\\n\\uf0a7 If the first sergeant gives the command from their post in a separate unit, they move in the\\nmost convenient manner to their new position at the left flank of the unit. If they give the\\ncommand while at the head of the company, they move in the same direction as the guidon\\nbearer.\\nCLOSING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PLATOONS\\n8-13. This movement is only executed when the company is in column with the platoons in column. The\\nformation has been faced to the right for marching with the first sergeant and platoon sergeants at their posts.\\n8-14. The first sergeant directs CLOSE ON THE LEADING PLATOON. The leading platoon sergeant\\ncommands STAND FAST. The leading platoon sergeant then faces to the left as in marching and marches,\\ninclining as necessary, to the trail of the company.\\n8-15. The succeeding platoon\u2019s platoon sergeant marches their platoon forward and commands Mark Time,\\nMARCH. They ensure that they give the command of execution MARCH when the squad leaders are three\\nsteps from the last Soldier in the leading platoon so that the Soldiers of the succeeding platoon begin marching\\nin place at the correct distance.\\n8-16. While Marking Time in formation, the Soldiers adjust position to ensure proper alignment and cover.\\nThe proper distance between Soldiers while marching is one-arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches (approximately\\n36 inches). If necessary, the squad leaders take the appropriate number of steps to close any gaps should the\\ntrail of the leading platoon be uneven. The rest of the formation adjusts as necessary.\\n8-17. After sensing that the members of the platoon have obtained proper alignment and cover, the platoon\\nsergeant commands Platoon, HALT. After commanding the platoon to Halt, the platoon sergeant faces to\\nthe left as in marching and marches, inclining as necessary, to the trail of the company.\\n8-18. The remaining platoons execute in the same manner as the succeeding platoon in order from front to\\nrear. The platoon sergeants wait until the platoon sergeant to their front gives the command Mark Time,\\nMARCH, before giving the command Forward, MARCH.\\n8-19. The platoon sergeants form at the trail of the company one step to the rear and evenly spaced. The\\nplatoon sergeants are now part of the formation. If the first sergeant wants exact cover and alignment, they\\ncommand COVER. The first sergeant remains at their post and marches the company.\\nCORRECTING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PLATOONS\\n8-20. The correct distance between platoons is five steps. To obtain correct distance (five steps) when the\\ncompany is marching in column or is in column at the Halt, the first sergeant directs CORRECT ON\\nLEADING PLATOON.\\n8-21. When at the Halt, on the directive CORRECT ON LEADING PLATOON, the platoon sergeant of\\nthe leading platoon commands (over the right shoulder) STAND FAST. The succeeding platoon sergeants\\ncommand (over the right shoulder) Forward, MARCH and then command Mark Time, MARCH and\\nPlatoon, HALT when correct distance is obtained.\\n8-22. While marching, on the directive CORRECT ON LEADING PLATOON, the platoon sergeant of\\nthe leading platoon commands (over the right shoulder) Half Step, MARCH. The succeeding platoon\\nsergeants command (over the right shoulder) CONTINUE TO MARCH, and then command Half Step,\\nMARCH as soon as the correct distance is obtained.\\n8-23. The first sergeant commands Forward, MARCH; (HALT) as soon as all platoons have obtained the\\ncorrect distance and are marching at the Half Step.\\n8-12 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFORMING A COLUMN OF TWOS AND RE-FORMING\\n8-24. The company forms a column of twos basically the same as the platoon. The first sergeant must allow\\nsufficient time for the platoon sergeants, and the squad leaders of the lead platoon, to give their supplementary\\ncommands before giving the command of execution.\\n8-25. The command for this movement is Column of twos from the right (left), MARCH. The leading\\nplatoon sergeant repeats the preparatory command. Other platoon sergeants give the supplementary\\ncommand Stand Fast. On the first sergeant\u2019s command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon executes\\nthe movement as in platoon drill. Other platoons execute the movement on their platoon sergeant\u2019s command.\\nSucceeding platoon sergeants give their commands to follow with the prescribed five-step distance between\\nplatoons.\\n8-26. Re-forming into a column of fours is executed only at the Halt. The command for this movement is\\nColumn of fours to the left (right), MARCH. On the first sergeant\u2019s command of execution, all platoons\\nexecute the movement simultaneously as described in platoon drill. As soon as the platoons are re-formed,\\nthe platoon sergeants automatically march the platoons forward and obtain the five-step distance between\\nplatoons.\\nFORMING A COMPANY MASS\\n8-27. The company may form in mass from a company in column (platoons in column) when halted or while\\nmarching. The company must be at Close Interval (Close Interval, MARCH) before the command Company\\nMass Left, MARCH is given.\\n8-28. On the preparatory command Company Mass Left, given at the Halt, the leading platoon sergeant\\ncommands Stand Fast. The platoon sergeants of the succeeding platoons command Column Half Left. On\\nthe command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon stands fast. The other platoons execute the Column\\nHalf Left and then execute a Column Half Right on the command of the platoon sergeants to a point (line)\\nthat ensures the platoons will be at Close Interval alongside the platoon to their right when halted. As the\\nplatoons come abreast of the base platoon, the platoon sergeants command Mark Time, MARCH. While the\\nplatoon is marking time, the members adjust their positions to ensure alignment on the Soldier to their right.\\nThe platoon sergeants allow their platoons to Mark Time for about eight counts and then command Platoon,\\nHALT.\\n8-29. On the preparatory command Company Mass Left while marching, given as the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface, the leading platoon sergeant gives the supplementary command Mark Time. The\\nsucceeding platoon sergeants command Column Half Left. On the command of execution MARCH, the\\nleading platoon begins to march in place. After marking time for about eight counts, the lead platoon sergeant\\ncommands Platoon, HALT. The other platoons form in the same manner as from the Halt.\\nNotes. 1. If the commander is in charge of the formation, on the command of execution MARCH,\\nthe first sergeant and guidon bearer halt and immediately face to the right (left) in marching and\\nreposition themselves centered on the company.\\n2.If the platoon sergeants are marching at their posts on the left flank of their platoons, they must\\nwait until the platoon sergeants to their front have commanded HALT and have moved to the\\nfront of the company before moving into position.\\nALIGNING A COMPANY IN MASS\\n8-30. To align a company in mass, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c As soon as the company has formed in mass, the first sergeant gives the command Order, ARMS\\n(if appropriate) and then commands At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS.\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution DRESS, the platoon sergeant of the right platoon marches by the\\nmost direct route to the right flank and verifies the alignment of as many ranks as necessary to\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-13Chapter 8\\nensure proper alignment in the same manner as aligning the platoon. When they have finished the\\nverification, the platoon sergeant returns to a position one step in front of and centered on the third\\nsquad, halts, and faces to the right. When the platoon sergeant has returned to their position, the\\nfirst sergeant commands Ready, FRONT. Platoon sergeants align themselves to the right. The\\nfirst sergeant directs the platoon sergeants to move left or right to ensure the platoon sergeants are\\nevenly spaced across the front.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF MARCH OF A MASS FORMATION\\n8-31. The company changes the direction of march in mass basically the same as a platoon column\\nmovement. This movement is normally executed with the commander at their post. For clarity purposes, the\\nterm \u201ccommander\u201d is used:\\n\\uf06c When executed from the Halt, the commander has the unit execute Right Shoulder Arms (if\\nappropriate), then faces in the desired direction of march, turns their head toward the formation,\\nand commands Right (Left) Turn, MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon leaders face to the half right (left) in\\nmarching and continue to march in an arc until parallel to the new direction of march. Then\\nthey begin marching with the Half Step, dressing on the right (left) flank platoon leader until\\nthe command Forward, MARCH is given.\\n\\uf0a7 The right (left) guide (the base squad leader in the direction of turn) faces to the right (left) in\\nmarching, takes one 30-inch step in the indicated direction, and then takes up the Half Step.\\nAll other squad leaders (front rank) face to the half right (left) in marching and continue to\\nmarch in an arc until they come on line with the guide.\\n\\uf0a7 At this time, they begin marching with the Half Step and dress (glancing out of the corner of\\nthe eye) in the direction of the turn until the command Forward, MARCH is given. On that\\ncommand, the dress is automatically to the right. All other members march forward and\\nexecute the movement in the same manner as their squad leaders.\\n\\uf06c When executed while marching, the movement is the same as from the Halt except that the\\ncompany commander faces about (marching backward) to give the command Right (Left) Turn,\\nMARCH. The commander then faces about and completes the turning movement themselves.\\nAfter the company has completed the turn, they face about, commands Forward, MARCH, and\\nagain faces about.\\nFORMING A COLUMN FROM A COMPANY MASS\\n8-32. This movement is normally executed with the commander at their post. For clarity purposes, the term\\n\u201ccommander\u201d is used. To form a company in column from a company mass at the Halt, the command is\\nColumn of Platoons, Right Platoon, Column Right (Column Half Right), MARCH. The right platoon\\nleader gives the supplementary command of Forward (Column Right or Column Half Right), and the other\\nplatoon leaders command Stand Fast:\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution MARCH, the right platoon marches in the direction indicated. All\\nother platoons follow (in sequence) in column, executing Column Half Right and Column Half\\nLeft on the commands of the platoon leaders.\\n\\uf06c To execute the movement when marching, the company commander commands Port, ARMS\\n(unless at Sling Arms), and then commands Column of Platoons, Right Platoon, Double Time,\\nMARCH. On the preparatory command, the right platoon leader gives the supplementary\\ncommand Double Time, and the other platoon leader gives the supplementary command Continue\\nto March. On the command of execution MARCH, the right platoon marches in double-time.\\nOther platoon leaders (in sequence) command Column Half Right, Double Time, MARCH and\\nColumn Half Left, MARCH to bring the succeeding platoons in column with the leading platoon.\\n\\uf06c The platoon leader and the platoon sergeant reposition themselves after the supplementary\\ncommand but before the command of execution.\\n8-14 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFORMING A COMPANY IN COLUMN WITH PLATOONS IN LINE\\nAND RE-FORMING\\n8-33. This movement is normally executed with the commander at their post. For clarity purposes, the term\\n\u201ccommander\u201d is used. To form a company in column with platoons in line from a column formation at the\\nHalt, the command is Column of platoons in line, MARCH. The platoon leader of the leading platoon gives\\nthe supplementary command Stand Fast. The second platoon leader gives the supplementary command\\nColumn Right. All other platoon leaders give the supplementary command Forward:\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon Stands Fast, and the second platoon\\nexecutes a Column Right, marches 12 steps past the right file of the first platoon, and executes a\\nColumn Left. As they come on line with the base platoon, the platoon leader commands Mark\\nTime, MARCH. After the platoon has marched in place for eight counts, the platoon leader\\ncommands Platoon, HALT. The succeeding platoons execute a Column Right at approximately\\nthe same location as the platoon to their front and execute a Column Left and then halt in the same\\nmanner as the second platoon. When the platoons have halted in position, the company\\ncommander commands Left, FACE. On that command, the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants\\nface in marching and assume their posts.\\n\\uf06c When executed while marching, the movements are basically the same as from the Halt except\\nthat the commander gives the command of execution as the right foot strikes the marching surface.\\nThe leading platoon leader commands Mark Time. On the preparatory command, the second\\nplatoon leader commands Column Right, and the succeeding platoon leaders command Continue\\nto March. On the command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon executes Mark Time and\\nmarches in place (approximately eight counts) until the platoon leader commands Platoon,\\nHALT. The other platoons execute the movement in the same manner as from the Halt.\\n\\uf06c To re-form in column with platoons in column, the company commander commands Right, Face;\\nColumn of Platoons, Left Platoon, MARCH. On the command Right, Face, the platoon leaders\\nand platoon sergeants face in marching and resume their posts in column. On the preparatory\\ncommand Column of Platoons, Left Platoon, the left platoon leader commands Forward,\\n(Column Left [Half Left]). All other platoon leaders command Column Half Left. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the left platoon executes the movement. The other platoon\\nleaders give the appropriate commands to follow the lead platoon at the correct distance.\\nNote. If necessary, the platoons following the second platoon automatically adjust the length of\\ntheir step to ensure correct distance from the platoon to their front.\\nDISMISSING THE COMPANY\\n8-34. The company is dismissed while at Attention. It is usually dismissed by the first sergeant:\\n\\uf06c The first sergeant commands TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR PLATOONS. The platoon sergeants\\nSalute. The first sergeant returns all Salutes with one Salute. After Salutes are exchanged, the first\\nsergeant and guidon bearer leave the formation. The platoon sergeants then dismiss their platoons\\nas in platoon drill.\\n\\uf06c When the company is dismissed by the company commander, they command TAKE CHARGE\\nOF YOUR PLATOONS. The platoon leaders salute. The company commander returns all\\nSalutes with one Salute. After the Salutes are exchanged, the company commander, guidon bearer,\\nfirst sergeant, and executive officer leave the formation:\\n\\uf0a7 The platoon leader(s) faces about and commands PLATOON SERGEANT. The platoon\\nsergeant faces to the right in marching and marches (inclines) around the squad leader(s),\\nhalts three steps in front of and centered on the platoon leader and faces to the right. Each\\nplatoon leader then directs TAKE CHARGE OF THE PLATOON. Salutes are exchanged.\\nThe platoon leaders leave the formation.\\n\\uf0a7 The platoon sergeants step forward three steps, face about, and dismiss the platoons as in the\\nplatoon drill.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-15Chapter 8\\nSECTION III \u2013 INSPECTIONS\\n8-35. This section discusses the procedures used to conduct inspections for a company drill. The two typical\\ninspections discussed are in-ranks inspections and in-quarters inspections.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n8-36. The following basic information applies to conducting inspections for a company drill:\\n\\uf06c The company has one prescribed formation for inspecting personnel and equipment in ranks\u2014\\ncompany in line with platoons in line. When inspecting crew-served weapons and vehicles, the\\npersonnel are normally positioned to the rear of the formation with the operator (gunner) standing\\nby their vehicle (weapon).\\nNote. If the commander is not scheduled to receive or inspect the company, the first sergeant and\\nplatoon sergeants remain at their posts and execute company drill from their posts. For continuity\\npurposes, the term \u201cfirst sergeant\u201d may also be used to denote the commander, just as \u201cplatoon\\nsergeant\u201d may be used to denote the platoon leader when they are executing drill from their posts.\\nIf the commander is inspecting, they and the platoon leaders execute the same as described below.\\n\\uf06c The first sergeant may conduct an in-quarters (barracks) inspection to include personal\\nappearance, individual weapons, field equipment, displays, maintenance, and sanitary conditions.\\n\\uf06c When field equipment is to be inspected, it should be arranged neatly and as directed by the leader\\nin charge of the inspection. Lay equipment out in a uniformed manner with all members\u2019\\nequipment arranged the same.\\nIN-RANKS INSPECTION (LINE FORMATIONS)\\n8-37. Use the following procedures to conduct an in-ranks inspection (line formation):\\n\\uf06c With the company in a line formation, the first sergeant directs PREPARE FOR INSPECTION.\\nOn that directive, the platoon sergeants face about, open ranks, and align the company as in\\nparagraphs 8-9 and 8-10. When all platoon sergeants are facing the front, the first sergeant\\ncommands AT EASE.\\nNote. During the inspection, the guidon bearer, officers, and NCOs not in ranks assume the\\nposition of attention as the inspecting officer approaches their positions and resume the at ease\\nposition after they have been inspected (they do not execute Inspection Arms). The company\\ncommander may direct the first sergeant and executive officer to accompany them during the\\ninspection. When so directed, the executive officer and first sergeant take a position at normal\\ninterval (close interval if the company is at close interval) to the left of the company commander.\\n\\uf06c The first sergeant begins the inspection by stepping forward and inspecting the guidon bearer. The\\nfirst sergeant then faces to the half left in marching and proceeds to the right of the line. As they\\napproach the right flank platoon, the platoon sergeant commands (over their right shoulder)\\nPlatoon, ATTENTION. When the first sergeant has halted directly in front of them, they report,\\n\u201cFirst Sergeant, the platoon is prepared for inspection.\u201d (If the commander is inspecting, Salutes\\nare exchanged.) The first sergeant inspects the platoon sergeant. The first sergeant then directs the\\nplatoon sergeant to lead through the inspection, faces to the half left in marching, and halts directly\\nin front of the squad leader of the first squad. As the first sergeant faces to the half left in marching,\\nthe platoon sergeant faces to the right in marching, inclines, and halts directly in front of the second\\nSoldier in the first squad and on line with and at Normal Interval (Close Interval) to the right of\\nthe first sergeant. The other platoon sergeants execute the same actions as the first sergeant\\napproaches their platoons.\\n8-16 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nNote. As soon as the platoon sergeant and first sergeant have halted in front of the first two\\nSoldiers, the platoon sergeant commands Second, Third, and Fourth Squads, AT EASE. When\\nmoving from Soldier to Soldier during the inspection, the first sergeant and platoon sergeant\\n(executive officer and first sergeant if the commander is inspecting) simultaneously face to the\\nright in marching, take two short steps (one step if the company is at close interval), halt, and face\\nto the left. After the first sergeant has inspected the last Soldier in the front rank, the platoon\\nsergeant hesitates momentarily and allows the first sergeant to precede them as the first sergeant\\ninspects the front rank from the rear. As the first sergeant begins to inspect the rear of each rank,\\nthe platoon sergeant commands the next squad to Attention. As they begin to inspect the next rank,\\nthe platoon sergeant commands the last rank inspected to stand At Ease. Normally, when\\ninspecting the rear of each rank, the first sergeant conducts a walking inspection. As the first\\nsergeant inspects the rear of the last Soldier in each rank, they turn and halt directly in front of the\\nsquad leader of the next rank. The platoon sergeant turns and halts directly in front of the second\\nSoldier. If the commander is inspecting, the executive officer and first sergeant march past\\n(behind) the company commander and assume their positions to the commander\u2019s left.\\n\\uf06c As the first sergeant halts and is directly in front of and facing the individual being inspected, the\\nindividual executes Inspection Arms. If the first sergeant wants to inspect the individual\u2019s weapon,\\nthey inspect the weapon first, then the individual\u2019s uniform and appearance. As soon as the first\\nsergeant grasps the weapon, the individual releases the weapon and resumes the Position of\\nAttention. When the first sergeant has finished inspecting the weapon, they return it in the same\\nmanner as it was received. The individual receives the weapon by grasping the center of the\\nhandguard just forward of the slip ring with the left hand and the small of the stock with the right\\nhand. They then execute Ready, Port Arms; Order Arms.\\nNote. In the event the first sergeant does not want to inspect the weapon, the individual remains\\nat Inspection Arms until the first sergeant has halted in front of and is facing the next Soldier. The\\nindividual then executes Ready, Port Arms, and Order Arms. As the first sergeant moves to the\\nrear of the rank being inspected, each Soldier, as the first sergeant approaches, unfastens the snap\\nof their scabbard, grasps the point of the scabbard with the left hand, and moves the point slightly\\nforward. The scabbard is held in position until the bayonet has been replaced or, if the bayonet is\\nnot inspected, until the first sergeant has moved to the next Soldier. At that time, the securing\\nstraps are fastened and the Position of Attention is resumed.\\n\\uf06c The correct method of manipulating a rifle for inspection is as follows:\\n\\uf0a7 When receiving the rifle from the inspected individual, reach forward and grasp the rifle at\\nthe upper portion of the handguard with the right hand. Lower the rifle diagonally to the left,\\ntwist the rifle slightly, insert the tip of the little finger of the left hand into the ejection port\\n(do not twist the rifle but insert the thumb into the receiver of the M14-series rifle), and look\\ninto the barrel. The finger reflects sufficient light for the inspection of the barrel.\\n\\uf0a7 Grasp the small of the stock with the left hand and raise the rifle to a horizontal position\\n(sights up) with the muzzle to the right. The rifle is centered on the body with the forearms\\nhorizontal and the palms up. Move the rifle horizontally to the left and inspect the upper\\nportion of the rifle beginning with the flash suppressor. Move the rifle slowly to the right\\ninspecting the butt. Return the rifle to the center of the body.\\n\\uf0a7 Keeping the rifle horizontal, rotate it 180 degrees (sights toward the body) so that the sights\\npoint toward the marching surface. Move the rifle horizontally to the left and inspect the\\nmuzzle. Move the rifle slowly to the right and inspect the butt. When moving the rifle across\\nthe body, twist the rifle as necessary and inspect the movable parts on the sides of the receiver.\\nHaving completed the inspection of the lower parts of the rifle, return it to the center of the\\nbody.\\n\\uf0a7 Keeping the rifle horizontal, rotate the rifle 180 degrees (sights away from the body) so that\\nthe sights are up. Release the left hand and return the rifle in the same manner as received.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-17Chapter 8\\n\\uf0a7 When inspecting a weapon other than a rifle, the inspector receives the weapon with their\\nright hand and inspects it in the most convenient manner. Having completed the inspection,\\nthe weapon is returned with the right hand in the same manner as received.\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant has completed the inspection of the platoon, the platoon sergeant\\ncommands the platoon to Attention and overtakes the first sergeant en route back to the front of\\nthe platoon. The platoon sergeant halts at their post facing to the front (Salutes are exchanged if\\nthe commander is inspecting). The first sergeant (or commander with or without the inspecting\\nparty) faces to the right in marching and moves to the next platoon. As soon as the first sergeant\\nhas cleared the first platoon, the platoon sergeant faces about, commands Close Ranks, MARCH\\nand AT EASE, and then faces about and executes At Ease. When the first sergeant has completed\\nthe inspection of the last platoon (exchanged Salutes with the platoon sergeant), they return to\\ntheir post at the center of the company and commands the company to Attention. They then dismiss\\nthe company, as previously described in paragraph 8-32.\\n\\uf06c When the company is inspected by an officer of a higher command, on the approach of the\\ninspecting officer, the company commander commands Company, ATTENTION. They then face\\nabout, salute, and report, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the company is prepared for inspection.\u201d The inspection\\nis conducted as previously described in paragraph 8-37, except that the company commander takes\\na position immediately to the left of the inspecting officer. The inspection is terminated by the\\ncompany commander in the same manner prescribed for a platoon sergeant.\\nIN-QUARTERS INSPECTION (STAND BY)\\n8-38. When the first sergeant wants to conduct an in-quarters inspection, the members are positioned on line\\nwith their equipment (or as near it as possible) :\\n\\uf06c The platoon sergeant positions themselves in the path of the inspecting officer at a point near their\\narea of responsibility. At the approach of the inspecting officer, the platoon sergeant commands\\nPlatoon, ATTENTION, salutes, and reports, \u201cSir, the platoon is prepared for inspection.\u201d\\nNote. When the situation dictates, the platoon sergeant may report to the inspecting officer outside\\nof the quarters. A designated individual commands the members to Attention as the inspector\\nenters the quarters (bay).\\n\\uf06c The platoon sergeant then guides the inspector along a route dictated by the physical arrangement\\nof the personnel and equipment. Upon entering the area, the highest ranking Soldier present\\ncommands AT EASE. As the inspector approaches each individual or their equipment, the\\nindividual automatically assumes the Position of Attention. When the inspector has moved to the\\nnext Soldier, the last Soldier inspected resumes the position of At Ease. As the inspector begins to\\nexit the area after completing the inspection, CARRY ON is commanded.\\nNote. When inspecting Soldiers\u2019 rooms, Attention is not commanded. The individuals\\nautomatically assume the Position of Attention as the inspector enters the room. The inspector then\\ncommands AT EASE. As the inspector approaches each Soldier, the Soldier assumes the Position\\nof Attention and resumes At Ease after they have been inspected.\\n8-18 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 9\\nBattalion and Brigade Drill\\n\u201cThe exterior splendor, the regularity of movements, the adroitness and at the same\\ntime firmness of the mass\u2014all this gives the individual Soldier the safe and calming\\nconviction that nothing can withstand his particular regiment or battalion.\u201d\\nColmar von der Goltz, 1843-1916 Rossback und Jena\\nFor the most part, battalion and brigade drill merely provides the procedures for\\nexecuting company or battalion drill in conjunction with other companies or battalions\\nin the same formation.\\nFor drill purposes, a battalion or brigade consists of a headquarters (staff), Colors, and\\ntwo or more companies or battalions. The right flank unit serves as base when in a line\\nformation; the leading element is the base when in column.\\nNote. Executive officers, first sergeants, and platoon sergeants form the same as in-company drill\\nfor all formations, unless otherwise specified.\\nSECTION I \u2013 BATTALION FORMATIONS\\n9-1. The battalion has two basic formations\u2014a line and a column. Separate elements may be arranged in\\nseveral variations within either formation: the battalion may be formed in line with the companies in line\\nwith platoons in line, or battalion in line with companies in column with platoons in line (see figure 9-1 on\\npage 9-2). From those formations, the battalion may be positioned in a battalion in column with companies\\nin column, or companies in mass, or companies in column with platoons in line (see figure 9-2 on page 9-3).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 9-1Chapter 9\\nFigure 9-1.

Battalion in column with companies in column or mass\\n\\uf06c Forming the battalion. To facilitate the forming of a larger unit, the commander normally alerts\\nthe component units as to the desired formation, time, place, route, uniform, and the sequence in\\nwhich the units will form. Unless the right guide\u2019s position at the formation site has been\\npreviously marked, the guides report to the site and receive instructions before the arrival of the\\ntroops:\\n\\uf0a7 The commissioned staff forms in one rank, at normal interval and centered on the commander.\\nStaff members are normally arranged in their numerical order from right to left. When enlisted\\nstaff personnel form as part of the officer staff, they form two steps to the rear of their\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 9-3Chapter 9\\nrespective staff officer. The command sergeant major (CSM) forms one step to the rear and\\nis centered on the Colors.\\n\\uf0a7 When the battalion participates as a separate element of a larger formation, or when space is\\nlimited, it is normally formed in a mass formation in the same manner as forming a company\\nmass (see figure 9-3).\\nFigure 9-3. Battalion in mass formation\\n\\uf0a7 The adjutant is responsible for the formation of troops. They take a position at the right flank\\nof the line on which the units are to form and faces down the line. The adjutant remains facing\\ndown the line until all units are formed and then marches to their post midway between the\\nline of troops and the proposed position of the commander. As the commander and their staff\\n9-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Battalion and Brigade Drill\\napproach, the adjutant commands (directs) the units to ATTENTION, faces the commander,\\nsalutes, and reports, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the battalion is formed.\u201d\\nNote. If guides are used, the adjutant takes their post as soon as the guides have been aligned.\\n\\uf0a7 The commander returns the Salute and commands POST. The adjutant marches forward,\\npasses to the commander\u2019s right, and takes their post as the right flank staff officer. The\\ncommander then commands or directs such actions as they desire.\\n\\uf0a7 Normally, the Colors are positioned at the center of the battalion when formed in line or\\ncolumn, and four steps to the rear of the staff when formed in mass.\\n\\uf06c Dismissing the battalion. To dismiss the battalion, the commander commands TAKE CHARGE\\nOF YOUR UNITS. The company commanders and battalion commander exchange Salutes. The\\nbattalion commander returns all Salutes with one Salute. They then dismiss their staff.\\nNote. In a battalion mass formation, the platoon leaders form as the first rank of troops. The right\\nflank platoon leader serves as the guide.\\n\\uf06c Inspecting the battalion. When the battalion is to be inspected, the adjutant forms the battalion in\\nline with companies in line and platoons in line:\\n\\uf0a7 The adjutant forms the troops, reports, and takes their position with the staff (as previously\\ndescribed in paragraph 9-1). When the adjutant has joined the staff, the battalion commander\\ndirects PREPARE FOR INSPECTION. Unit commanders face about and give the same\\ndirective. The platoon leaders prepare their platoons for inspection in the same manner as in\\ncompany drill. When all of the platoons in each company have completed opening ranks and\\nhave dressed right, the company commander faces the battalion commander. When all\\ncompany commanders are again facing them, the battalion commander commands AT EASE.\\nNote. Because of the time involved in inspecting a battalion, the commander normally directs their\\nstaff to inspect the companies while they inspect the Colors and make a general inspection of the\\nbattalion. The Color guards do not execute Inspection Arms.\\n\\uf0a7 As the battalion commander (or their designated staff officer) approaches the company, the\\ncompany commander faces about, salutes, and reports, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, ______ Company is\\nprepared for inspection.\u201d The inspecting officer then proceeds to the first platoon to be\\ninspected. The company commander takes a position to the left of the inspecting officer. The\\nplatoons are inspected in the same manner as explained in company drill. In the event a\\nplatoon has already been inspected by a staff officer or is waiting to be inspected by a staff\\nofficer and the battalion commander approaches, the battalion commander is invited to inspect\\nthe platoon.\\n\\uf0a7 When the inspection has been completed and the battalion commander is en route back to\\ntheir post, the company commanders bring their units to ATTENTION, CLOSE RANKS,\\nand AT EASE. When the battalion commander has returned to the front of the formation and\\nall staff officers have completed their inspection, the battalion commander commands\\nBattalion, ATTENTION and dismisses the battalion (as previously described).\\n\\uf0a7 If the battalion is being inspected by a higher commander and their staff, the battalion\\ncommander reports to the inspecting officer in the same manner as the company commanders.\\nThe battalion commander\u2019s staff takes a position to the left of the higher inspecting staff and\\nescorts them to the unit. The battalion commander escorts the higher commander.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 9-5Chapter 9\\nSECTION II \u2013 BRIGADE FORMATIONS\\n9-2. The brigade, like the battalion, has two basic formations\u2014a line and a column.

It is the noblest and proudest form\\nof drill. Based on the \u2018blunt whetstone\u2019 of drill instruction to recruits it was for many\\nhundreds of years the foundation of battle discipline in all Armies\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cToday, once the elements of discipline have been instilled through drill on the parade\\nsquare, it develops, naturally, into various forms of crew drill, gun drill, and battle drill\\nbut the aim of discipline remains unchanged. This aim is the conquest of fear. Drill\\nhelps to achieve this because when it is carried out Soldiers tend to lose their\\nindividuality and are unified into a group under obedience to orders.\u201d\\n\u201cIf Soldiers are to give their best in war they must be united. Discipline seeks through\\ndrill to instill into all ranks this sense of unity, by requiring them to obey orders as one.\\nA Ceremonial parade, moreover, provides an occasion for Soldiers to express pride in\\ntheir performance, pride in the Regiment or Corps and pride in the profession of Arms.\u201d\\nGeneral Sir Harold Alexander, Ceremonial for the\\nArmy Ministry for Defense, Army Department\\nNovember 1968\\nNote. See appendix G for a checklist for conducting a successful ceremony.\\nChapter 10\\nReviews\\nThis chapter discusses the general history of the review and the different types of\\nreviews used in the Army today.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n10-1. Reviews can be traced to the Middle Ages when rulers, as a way of showing their strength, were likely\\nto have military ceremonies. Military ceremonies and reviews are a popular tradition which carries on today\\nin military forces around the world.\\n10-2. In the American Army, reviews were originally outlined in Baron Friedrich von Steuben\u2019s Blue Book\\nand practiced by revolutionary Soldiers. A review consisted of four stages: a formation of troops, presentation\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 10-1Chapter 10\\nand honors, inspection, and a march in review. Today\u2019s reviews have incorporated three additional stages:\\nhonors to the Nation, remarks, and a conclusion. The presence of the band represents the significant role that\\nthe drum, fife, and other musical instruments have played throughout military history for signaling in camp\\nor on the battlefield. The presence of the Colors at the center of the formation represents their presence at the\\nforefront of the unit during the heat of battle.\\n10-3. At the beginning of the 17th century, armies throughout the world were adopting the regimental system.\\nRegiments were assigned a specific Color or number for ease of identification and position on the battlefield.\\nIn battle, the Color (or flag) party marched at the front and center of its unit as a point for the unit to dress\\non. By leading the unit in battle, the Colors became prime targets, as victories in those days were expressed\\nin terms of the number of enemy Colors captured; consequently, the Color party bore the brunt of the battle\\nand suffered heavy casualties. Historically, in the American Army, the Colors have been placed in the center\\nof the formation and have been considered part of the company on the immediate right of the Colors. This\\ncompany is still called the Color unit:\\n\\uf06c In Infantry regulations of 1812, the lineup of companies from right to left was determined by the\\nseniority of the company commander, with the senior on the right. The manual for U.S. Infantry\\ntactics in 1862 placed the senior commander on the right and the second senior on the left with the\\nother eight companies in between. After they were lined up, the companies were then numbered\\nfirst through tenth from right to left. In the Infantry drill regulations of 1892, companies continued\\nto be aligned by seniority. Between 1910 and 1970, companies were designated by letters of the\\nalphabet and lined up from right to left: headquarters company, rifle companies in alphabetical\\norder, and then any combat support companies. The Colors, however, remained posted in the\\ncenter of the formation.\\n\\uf06c Musical elements (usually drums and fifes, and sometimes a band) were used during actual battle\\nand marched 12 to 15 paces to the rear of the formation. By 1892, the Infantry drill regulations\\nposted bands and field music on the right of the formation or at the head of the formation when it\\nmoved in column.\\n10-4. Honors appears to have originated as musical fanfare and later a gun salute was added. The\\ncombination of the two now constitute military honors:\\n\\uf06c The custom of announcing the arrival of royalty and heads of state with a fanfare of trumpets or\\ndrum rolls had its origin in England. It is ironic that drum Ruffles and the two-note bugle call\\nFlourishes, used in this manner today, have all but disappeared in the British Commonwealth\\nwhile the tradition is still carried on in the United States.\\n\\uf06c The colonists brought many of the military customs of their mother country with them when they\\ncame to America. At the time of the French-Indian Wars, Soldiers were instructed to \u201crest (present\\narms) and beat two ruffles\u201d for the Royal Governor of Virginia. In 1776, officers of the\\nContinental Army were advised that \u201cthe adjutant is to order a drum and fife to give two ruffles\\nto a major general and one to a brigadier.\u201d\\n\\uf06c When Baron von Steuben wrote his manual of discipline, he stated that there were to be \u201ccertain\\nruffles\u201d for generals. It is interesting to note that General George Washington was not accorded\\nruffles. Instead, his arrival was announced by a march\u2014more than likely \u201cWashington\u2019s\\nMarch\u201d\u2014that is still played today. In time, this custom was extended to include governors of\\nsovereign states and visiting foreign dignitaries.\\n\\uf06c Ruffles were not considered elegant and were used exclusively by the military. In some cases they\\nwere even accorded to the officer of the day.\\n\\uf06c It was some time before trumpets were added to the drum rolls; it is believed they were also used\\nduring the War of 1812. Honors for dignitaries were modified to include a flourish of trumpets\\ncalled the \u201cThree Cheers.\u201d It is likely that this particular salute evolved into the \u201cRuffles and\\nFlourishes\u201d as they are played today.\\n\\uf06c Navy records indicate that the regulations of 1876 stipulated there would be a ruffle of drums to\\nannounce the President\u2019s arrival but made no mention of the trumpet flourishes. A later regulation\\n(1893) stated that the chief executive would receive four \u201cRuffles and Flourishes.\u201d\\n\\uf06c Gun salutes may be traced back to a period when it took a long time to reload guns. By firing all\\nits guns at once, the battery or fort was left defenseless. The number of guns fired as a salute to\\n10-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Reviews\\nhonor a U.S. President was not established until 1841. Before that, presidential honors included\\none gun for every state. It reached at least 24 guns before it was decided that any more guns would\\nbe unrealistic and the number of 21 was adopted in 1841. In 1875, the United States adopted\\n21 guns for the international salute and that number is currently used as honors for all dignitaries\\nof rank equivalent to the President.\\nSECTION II \u2013 TYPES OF REVIEWS\\n10-5. A review is a military ceremony used to\u2014\\n\\uf06c Honor a visiting, high-ranking commander, official, or dignitary, and/or permit them to observe\\nthe state of training of a command.\\n\\uf06c Present decorations and awards.\\n\\uf06c Honor or recognize unit or individual achievements.\\n\\uf06c Commemorate events.\\n10-6. Normally, a review is conducted with a battalion or larger troop unit; however, a composite or\\nrepresentative element consisting of two or more platoons may serve the same purpose. A review consists of\\nthe following steps in sequence:\\n\\uf06c Formation of troops.\\n\\uf06c Presentation of command and honors (although primarily a characteristic of a parade, \u201csound off\u201d\\nmay be included here to enhance the ceremony).\\n\\uf06c Inspection. (The inspection stage may be omitted for decorations, awards, or individual\\nrecognition ceremonies.)\\n\\uf06c Honors to the Nation.\\n\\uf06c Remarks.\\n\\uf06c March in review.\\n\\uf06c Conclusion.\\nNote. If retreat is conducted as part of the review, it occurs after presentation of the command and\\nhonors and before the inspection. Honors to the Nation is omitted.\\n10-7. Other ceremonial activities, or combinations thereof, that may be incorporated within the framework\\nof a review are reviews with\u2014\\n\\uf06c Decorations, awards, and individual retirement.\\n\\uf06c Change of command, activation, or inactivation of units.\\n\\uf06c Retreat.\\n\\uf06c Retreat and retirement, decorations, and awards.\\n\\uf06c Retreat and change of command, activation, or inactivation of units.\\nNote. Review with change of command should not be combined with an awards ceremony.\\nAwarding a decoration to an outgoing command is accomplished separately from, and preferably\\nbefore, a review at which the responsibility of command is transferred.\\n10-8. In order that a commander may review their own command or accompany a visiting reviewing officer,\\nthey normally designate an officer of their command as commanding officer of troops (known as COT). The\\nCOT is responsible for the preparation of the troops for the review.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 10-3Chapter 10\\n10-9. The ready line and final line on which the units are to form and the route of march are marked or\\ndesignated before beginning the ceremony (see figure 10-1 on page 10-4):\\n\\uf06c The primary function of the ready line is to enable the unit commander to arrange their unit into\\nthe prescribed formation before movement to the final line. The ready line is to the rear of the final\\nline. Flags or appropriate markings are used to designate the post of the reviewing officer and the\\npoints where Eyes, RIGHT and Ready, FRONT are to be commanded (6 steps to the reviewing\\nofficer\u2019s right and left and from 6 to 20 steps in front of the reviewing officer).\\n\\uf06c Commanders should determine the length of their formation (steps) so that they know how far\\nbeyond the ready front marker (six steps beyond the reviewing officer) they command Ready,\\nFRONT.

At the beginning of the ceremony, the outgoing commander should assume the role of host\\nor host commander. The senior official or commander designated to \u201cpass the organizational\\nColor\u201d should assume the role of an honored guest or reviewing officer except during that brief\\nportion of the ceremony wherein they may be called upon to act as a host or host commander for\\nthe purpose of passing the organizational Color. Since the inspection of troops normally occurs\\nearly in the ceremony, the incoming commander is also at that time treated as a guest and is\\nexpected to accompany the outgoing commander and senior official during the inspection. After\\nthe organizational Color has been passed, the incoming commander should assume the role of host\\nor host commander, and the senior official and outgoing commander both become honored guests\\nor reviewing officers at this point and remain as such for the balance of the ceremony (see\\nfigure 10-10).\\nFigure 10-10.

A special review is conducted by a composite or representative unit and serves the same purposes\\nas a standard review when a larger formation is not practical. The composite unit normally consists of a band,\\nColors, two or more platoons, and a salute battery (when appropriate). The reduced formation is not a reason\\nto eliminate any of the components of a review or change their sequence:\\n\\uf06c A special review is essentially the same as a battalion or larger unit review, except\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 The troops are formed on a final line.\\n\\uf0a7 Attention and Adjutant\u2019s Call are not sounded.\\n\\uf0a7 Neither the adjutant nor a staff participate.\\n\\uf0a7 Unit guidons are not used in this formation.

The band steps off playing a march on the command of\\nForward, MARCH. Platoon leaders remain six steps to the front of and centered on their\\nplatoons. Platoon sergeants remain one step to the rear of and centered on their platoon.\\n\\uf0a7 Platoon leaders command Column Left, MARCH at the first turn marker and Left Flank,\\nMARCH when centered on the reviewing line.\\n\\uf06c Indoor ceremonies retain the same sequence as a normal review, excluding elements that are\\nprecluded because of space. Generally, a pass in review cannot be conducted indoors.\\n10-26 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 11\\nParades\\nThe term \u201cparade\u201d had various meanings to Continental Army troops camped at Valley\\nForge. It could mean to form, march, and drill. Present-day parade procedures\\noriginated from the daily activities conducted then to form, organize, instruct, and issue\\nparole and countersign words to the various guards on duty (outpost, picket, camp, and\\nquarters). Early parades also enabled commanders to give special instructions to\\nsubordinate leaders and to make command announcements. In the U.S. Army\\nregulations of 1863, reviews were a type of parade, and \u201cdress parades\u201d were\\nconducted daily, except on extraordinary and urgent occasions. The parade remains\\nbasically the same as the review except that it has retained its original intent\u2014a method\\nwhereby unit commanders could inspect troops, present awards, and issue information.\\nThe sequence of a parade has the following steps\u2014formation of troops, sound off by\\na band, honors to the Nation, presentation, manual of arms, report, orders published,\\nofficers center, pass in review.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n11-1. Battalion and brigade parades are opened by the adjutant\u2019s call sounded on a trumpet. This call has\\nopened parades of the American forces for over 150 years. After some preliminaries, the adjutant directs\\nSOUND OFF and the band plays three chords. Having sounded off, the band marches in front of the troops\\nand then countermarches to its original position. This March across the front of the line is said to have\\noriginated with the Crusades (A.D. 1095 to 1260). The troops offering themselves for holy service were\\ndrawn up in a long formation and the band countermarched only before those chosen to serve. In American\\nceremonies, the sound off has been handed down as a ceremonial tradition.\\n11-2. After the band sounds off, the commanding officer may, if they wish, give the troops some Facings or\\nmovements of the manual of arms. This was the traditional way in which they established control over their\\ncommand, and it has been practiced in the United States since the Revolutionary War.\\n11-3. Parades in the Revolutionary Army were usually held at \u201cTroops\u201d or about 8 AM and was the time\\nused for sergeants to call the roll and report it to the adjutant. After the sergeants had returned to their posts,\\nthe commander directed that necessary orders and information be reported. After the adjutant had read the\\norders, they announced Parade is dismissed. At that time, officers moved to a position centered on the\\ncommanding officer. As the commander gave specific instructions to the officers, the first sergeants would\\nmarch their units back to their respective company areas where they would be dismissed.\\nSECTION II \u2013 PREPARATION\\n11-4. The appearance and movement of troops in formation are the primary characteristics of a parade. The\\npreparation and organization of troops for a parade are similar to that of a review. In a parade, since the COT\\nis also the reviewing officer, the distance between the troops and the commander is greater than that for a\\nreview. Other differences are that the band conducts Sound Off, the inspection is omitted, a report is rendered,\\norders are published, and officers and guidons are marched forward and centered on the commander. If retreat\\nis scheduled, honors to the Nation are conducted concurrently with retreat.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 11-1Chapter 11\\nSECTION III \u2013 TYPES OF PARADES\\n11-5. The procedures for conducting a ceremonial battalion parade, a ceremonial brigade parade, and street\\nparades are discussed herein. The ceremonial battalion parade and ceremonial brigade parade are conducted\\nvery similar in nature, but a brigade ceremonial parade is conducted in a larger scale with a few differences.\\nCEREMONIAL BATTALION PARADE\\n11-6. The procedures for conducting a ceremonial battalion parade begin with the formation of troops. The\\nadjutant then directs Sound Off to the battalion formation followed by honors to the Nation. Immediately\\nafter honors, the adjutant announces Order Arms and presents the battalion to the battalion commander. The\\ncommander may direct manual of arms and then have the commanders report that their unit is accounted for.\\nOrders will then be published, officers will conduct a center march, and then finally the pass in review and\\nthe conclusion of the parade.\\nFORMATION OF TROOPS\\n11-7. Units are moved to their positions on the ready line in the most convenient manner. The commander\\nprescribes the routes, sequence, and time of arrival on the ready line. The commander and their staff take\\ntheir posts before adjutant\u2019s call. The procedure for moving from the ready line to the final line is the same\\nas for a review.\\nSOUND OFF\\n11-8. After the battalion has been formed, aligned, and given Parade Rest on the final line, the adjutant\\ndirects SOUND OFF and assumes the position of Parade Rest. The adjutant remains facing the formation:\\n\\uf06c At the directive Sound Off, the band plays three sound off chords. At the conclusion of the third\\nchord, the band moves forward playing a march in quick time. The band executes a left turn to\\nmarch across the front of the troops. At the left of the line of troops, the band countermarches and\\nreturns over the same ground to the right of the line. After the band has passed beyond the right\\nof the troops, it executes a right turn, countermarches again, and halts in its original position.\\n\\uf06c When the band has halted, it ceases playing at the next convenient place in the music and again\\nplays the three sound off chords. (Trooping the line by the band may be eliminated when\\nceremonies are conducted indoors during inclement weather and space is limited.)\\nNote. Retreat, when scheduled, is integrated at this point. Upon completion of the sound off\\nchords, the band pauses briefly and then plays retreat (by the trumpet section) without a command\\nfrom the adjutant. Upon completion of retreat, the adjutant comes to Attention and directs BRING\\nYOUR UNITS TO ATTENTION AND PRESENT ARMS. The commander and their staff\\nassume Parade Rest, Attention, Present Arms, and Order Arms with the adjutant. The adjutant\\nfaces about and salutes. The adjutant\u2019s Salute is the signal for the band to play \u201cTo the Color\u201d or\\nthe national anthem. At the conclusion of \u201cTo the Color\u201d or the national anthem, the adjutant\\ncomes to Order Arms, faces about, and directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO ORDER ARMS.\\nAfter the last unit comes to Order Arms, the adjutant faces about.\\nHONORS TO THE NATION\\n11-9. If retreat is not conducted, the adjutant (after the band has completed Sound Off) assumes the position\\nof Attention and directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO ATTENTION AND PRESENT ARMS. Unit\\ncommanders assume the position of Attention, face about, and command Company, ATTENTION, Present,\\nARMS. They face about and salute. When all units are at Present Arms, the adjutant faces about and salutes.\\nThis is the signal for the band to play the national anthem. The battalion commander and their staff execute\\nPresent, ARMS on their command on the first note of the music.\\n11-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Parades\\nPRESENTATION\\n11-10. Upon completion of the national anthem, the battalion commander and their staff execute Order,\\nARMS on their command. The adjutant terminates their Salute, faces about, and directs BRING YOUR\\nUNITS TO ORDER ARMS. Unit commanders terminate their Salute, face about, command Order, ARMS,\\nand then face (back) to the front. When all units are at Order Arms, the adjutant faces about, salutes, and\\nreports Sir or Ma\u2019am, the parade is formed. The battalion commander returns the Salute and commands\\nPOST. The adjutant marches forward, passes by the battalion commander\u2019s right, and takes their post as the\\nright flank member of the staff.\\nMANUAL OF ARMS\\n11-11. After the adjutant has joined the staff, the battalion commander commands such movements in the\\nmanual of arms as they may desire. When desired, the commander may direct, rather than command, HAVE\\nYOUR UNITS EXECUTE THE MANUAL OF ARMS. The unit commanders, in sequence from right to\\nleft, command Right Shoulder, ARMS; Port, ARMS; Left Shoulder, ARMS; Order, ARMS. When the unit\\non the right has completed all the movements, the next unit then begins and so on until the last unit has\\ncompleted the movements.\\nREPORT\\n11-12. When all units have completed the manual of arms, the battalion commander then directs RECEIVE\\nTHE REPORT. The adjutant returns to their position at the center of the command and commands\\nREPORT. Unit commanders in succession, from right to left, salute and report \u201c________ Company, all\\npresent or accounted for.\u201d The adjutant returns each commander\u2019s Salute. After receiving the report, the\\nadjutant faces about, salutes, and reports \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all present or accounted for.\u201d\\nPUBLISHING OF ORDERS\\n11-13. The battalion commander returns the Salute and directs PUBLISH THE ORDERS. The adjutant\\nfaces about and directs ATTENTION TO ORDERS (they then read the orders). More information about\\nAttention to Orders can be found in appendix G.\\nOFFICERS CENTER MARCH\\n11-14. After reading the orders, the adjutant directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO PARADE REST:\\n\\uf06c Unit commanders face about and command Parade, REST. They then face about and come to\\nParade Rest. When all units are at Parade Rest, the adjutant commands (loud enough for the band\\nto hear) Officers (pause), Center (long pause), MARCH. They then face about and takes their\\npost with the staff:\\n\\uf0a7 On the command Officers, all officers come to Attention and guidon bearers come to Carry\\nGuidon.\\n\\uf0a7 On the command Center, when companies are in mass formation, the company commanders\\nand guidon bearers face to the center. Officers commanding platoons move one step forward\\nand face to the center. Executive officers move through the interval between units nearest to\\nthe center and take their posts in the column formed by the platoon leaders.\\n\\uf0a7 At the command MARCH, the band plays marching music and continues to play until the\\nofficers have halted in front of the commander. Officers and guidon bearers close to the center,\\nhalt, and individually face to the front. Company commanders, when moving to the center,\\nface half right or half left in marching, march to the front, and close on a line four steps in\\nadvance of the line of guidon bearers. The guidon bearers close on their own line, each taking\\na post to the rear of their company commander. All other officers close on the line of platoon\\nleaders (see figure 11-1 on page 11-4).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 11-3Chapter 11\\nFigure 11-1.

They halt the leading rank in line, three steps\\nfrom the line of companies. The senior commander then commands Post (pause), MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 At the command Post, the officers and guidon bearers face outward.\\n\\uf0a7 At the command MARCH, the officers and guidon bearers step off and return to their posts\\nand come to Parade Rest. The music ceases when the last officer has taken their post and\\ncome to Parade Rest.\\n\\uf06c During the execution of Officers Center and Officers Post, except when saluting, all guidon\\nbearers remain at Carry Guidon.\\nPASS IN REVIEW\\n11-15. When all officers have returned to their posts and the band has stopped playing, the battalion\\ncommander directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO ATTENTION. Unit commanders assume the position of\\nAttention, face about, and command Company, ATTENTION. Then they face about. When all units are at\\nAttention, the battalion commander directs PASS IN REVIEW. The battalion passes in review in the same\\nmanner as prescribed for a review except the units render honors when six steps to the left of the COT and\\nstaff, and terminate honors when the unit is six steps to the right of the COT and staff. The COT and staff\\nthen assume the role of the reviewing party at their location on the field.\\n11-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Parades\\nCONCLUSION\\n11-16. When the last element of troops has passed the reviewing stand and executed Ready Front, the band\\nceases playing and goes immediately into an eight-bar drum cadence. On the first beat following drum\\ncadence, the band begins playing (in place) the official version of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d\\nbeginning at the introduction. On the second time through letter A (or ninth bar), the drum major has the\\nband march forward and execute a left turn onto the reviewing line while continuing to play until the\\ncompletion of the chorus. The completion of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along\u201d terminates the ceremony. It\\nis appropriate for spectators to rise and stand at the position of Attention while \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling\\nAlong\u201d plays.\\nCEREMONIAL BRIGADE PARADE\\n11-17. The brigade ordinarily is formed in line with battalions in mass formations. The parade is the same\\nas the ceremonial battalion parade with the following exceptions:\\n\\uf06c The brigade commander is substituted for battalion commander, and brigade for battalion, in the\\ndescription.\\n\\uf06c In moving across the front of the brigade, the band passes in front of the line of battalion\\ncommanders during the Sound Off.\\n11-18. The battalions execute Present Arms, Order Arms, Parade Rest, and come to Attention on the\\ncommand of execution of their respective commanders. Reports are made by the battalion commanders\\ninstead of company commanders.\\n11-19. At the command of execution MARCH, of Officers, Center, MARCH, the battalion commanders,\\ntheir staffs, and Colors close on the line of battalion commanders and staffs. The company commanders face\\nto the half right or half left in marching and close on a line four steps to the rear of the battalion Color. The\\nguidon bearers face half right or half left in marching and close on a line four steps back of the company\\ncommanders. The other officers face half right or half left in marching and close on a line four steps behind\\nthe guidon bearers. The CSM remains in place and assumes command of the battalion.\\n11-20. The officers, guidon bearers, and Colors having closed and faced to the front, the senior battalion\\ncommander commands Forward, MARCH. The center officer of the leading rank is the guide. On the\\ncommand of the senior battalion commander, the officers, guidon bearers, and Colors are halted with the\\nleading ranks six steps from the brigade commander. They salute the brigade commander; the brigade\\ncommander returns the Salute. The commands Present, ARMS and Order, ARMS are given by the senior\\nbattalion commander.\\n11-21. The brigade commander commands Officers, Post (pause), MARCH. On the command Post, the\\nColors execute Reverse March. All others execute About Face. On the command of execution MARCH, the\\nofficers, Colors, and guidon bearers march forward. The senior battalion commander commands Officers,\\nHALT so that the rank of battalion commanders is on line with its original position. The senior battalion\\ncommander then commands Post (pause), MARCH. On the command Post, the battalion commanders and\\nstaffs face outward, the battalion Color guard executes wheeling movements, and on the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the Color guard marches back to its original position. The company commanders,\\nguidon bearers, and other officers face to the half right or half left in marching and move back to their original\\npositions.\\nSTREET PARADES\\n11-22. For street parades, troops are formed and marched in the most convenient manner. Street parades\\nmay include military vehicles. Towed or transported weapons add to the drama of a street parade. Cargo\\nvehicles are included only to increase the size of the display.\\n\\uf06c Practical formations for street parades are\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Columns of threes and fours.\\n\\uf0a7 Two or more columns of threes and fours abreast.\\n\\uf0a7 Mass formation.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 11-5Chapter 11\\n\\uf06c The vehicles move in a single column or column of twos, threes, or fours abreast, as the width of\\nthe street permits.\\n\\uf06c In order to keep military units in the same cadence, units should not march between two bands.\\n.\\n11-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 12\\nHonor Guards\\nIn the Continental Army, honor guards were used as a protective measure and as a\\nmeans of showing the improvement in discipline in the newly formed army. They were\\nprobably selected specifically for their size and strength and maybe their proven\\nprowess in combat. Today, the honor guard formation is a special courtesy to visiting\\ndignitaries. Members of the guard are selected for their Soldierly appearance and\\nsuperior discipline.\\nSECTION I \u2013 BASIC INFORMATION\\n12-1. The basic information herein applies to all honor guards:\\n\\uf06c An honor guard consists of a band, Colors, salute battery (when available and appropriate), and a\\nformation of troops. Honor guards render personal honors to persons of high military or civilian\\nrank or position upon arrival or departure from a military command. Honor guards are not a\\nsubstitute for those ceremonies appropriate in a review or parade.\\n\\uf06c An honor guard should not be so large as to compromise the exceptional standards required of\\nhonor guards. Uniforms will be those prescribed in Army regulations and tables of allowance.\\n\\uf06c The senior commander or their appointed representative is the host and takes part in the ceremony.\\nThey are briefed on the sequence of events and advises the person to be honored of actions that\\nwill take place.\\n\\uf06c Before the arrival of the person(s) to be honored, the honor guard commander positions the band,\\nformation of troops, and salute battery from right to left in that order. The troops are formed in\\nline of companies or platoons with the Colors centered. When conditions dictate, the salute battery\\nmay be located separately but its control and purpose must not be impaired.\\nSECTION II \u2013 SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS\\n12-2. The sequence of events for conducting an honor guard are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c At the approach of the person(s) to be honored, the honor guard commander faces about,\\ncommands Honor guard, ATTENTION, and then faces about again. The host welcomes the\\nperson(s) to be honored on arrival, escorts them to the position not more than 20 steps in front of\\nand facing the honor guard commander and takes their position on the guest\u2019s left. When the\\nperson(s) to be honored has halted in their position, the honor guard commander faces about,\\ncommands Present, ARMS, faces about, and Salutes.\\n\\uf06c As the honor guard commander executes the Hand Salute, the band begins the appropriate honors.\\nWhen a salute battery is employed, the first round is fired simultaneously with the first note of the\\nmusic and remaining rounds are fired at 3-second intervals. All military personnel in the vicinity\\nof the honor guard formation, except those on security duty, salute during the firing of the cannon\\nsalute and the rendering of honors (see AR 600-25).\\nNote. If a foreign dignitary\u2019s honors include their national anthem, the sequence of the ceremony\\nis: honors, inspection, and \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along\u201d concluding the ceremony.\\n\\uf06c On the completion of the honors, the honor guard commander terminates their Salute, faces about,\\nand commands Order, ARMS. The honor guard commander then faces about.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 12-1Chapter 12\\n\\uf06c At this time, the honoree(s) and host march forward and halt three steps from the honor guard\\ncommander. The honor guard commander salutes and reports \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the honor guard is\\nprepared for inspection.\u201d The band begins to play appropriate music upon the salute of the guard\\ncommander and continues to play until the members of the reviewing party have returned to their\\nposts. The guard commander then guides the honoree(s) and host to the right of the band. The\\ninspecting party passes along the front and rear of the line of troops, to include the salute battery\\n(if used), with the option of omitting the salute battery from the inspection if its distance from the\\nremainder of the honor guard is prohibitive.\\n\\uf06c The honor guard commander takes a position on the right of the person(s) honored and guides\\nthem through the inspection. The host takes a position on the right of the honor guard commander.\\n\\uf06c The inspection begins at the right of the band. The inspecting party passes along the front rank of\\ntroops. Ranks are not opened; the individual members of the honor guard do not come to\\nInspection Arms or execute Eyes Right.\\n\\uf06c The members of the inspecting party render Hand Salutes when they pass in front of the Colors.\\n\\uf06c The inspection terminates at the right flank of the band. The honor guard commander commands\\nParty, HALT. The bandmaster has the band play softly until the reviewing party members begin\\nmarching back to their posts. The honor guard commander faces to the half left in marching, takes\\ntwo steps, halts, and faces about. The host repositions themselves to the left of the honoree(s).\\nWhen the host is in position, the honor guard commander and the honoree(s) exchange Salutes.\\nUpon termination of the Salutes, the honoree(s) and the host immediately face to the half left in\\nmarching and return to their posts. The honor guard commander hesitates momentarily, then faces\\nto the right in marching, and returns to their post.\\n\\uf06c After the inspection is terminated and the honoree(s) and host return to their positions, the honor\\nguard is given Present, ARMS and the band plays the national anthem. If the honoree(s) is a\\nforeign dignitary, the national anthem of their country is played first, followed by an approximate\\n3-second drum roll and the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\\n\\uf06c When \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d ends, the command Order, ARMS is given. The honor guard\\ncommander faces about after the command for Order Arms is given and remains at Attention while\\nthe band plays one chorus of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d beginning at the introduction. At\\nthe completion of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d the honor guard commander salutes and\\nannounces \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, this concludes the ceremony.\u201d The honor guard remains at Attention\\nuntil the honoree(s) has departed. The band may play incidental background music while the\\nhonoree(s) is being introduced to the staff and other guests.\\nSECTION III \u2013 HONOR CORDON CEREMONIES\\n12-3. In addition to a scheduled honor guard ceremony, an honor cordon\u2014a line of Soldiers to honor a\\ndignitary upon entering or exiting from a given place or vehicle\u2014may be used when welcoming or\\nbidding farewell to distinguished visitors. The ceremony consists of a select group of Soldiers with\\ncharacteristics associated with honor guards, designated to honor and provide security at the immediate\\narrival or departure site:\\n\\uf06c The honor cordon normally consists of two squads, a senior sergeant, a cordon commander, and a\\nhost. When deemed appropriate, the commander may elect to use a band, Colors, and\\ndistinguishing flags:\\n\\uf0a7 Arrival. Upon arrival of the craft or vehicle, the cordon is marched to a position near the exit\\n(ramp) in two columns, centered on the exit, faced to the center, and dressed with about three\\nsteps distance between the ranks. As the honored guest(s) and greeting party depart the\\nimmediate vicinity of the exit, and approach within three steps of the host, the cordon\\ncommander commands Present, ARMS, and the entire cordon salutes simultaneously. After\\nthe honored guest(s) and all greeting party members have cleared the formation, the cordon\\ncommander commands Order, ARMS, and the cordon members come to Order Arms\\nsimultaneously (see figure 12-1 on page 12-4).\\n\\uf0a7 Departure. The formation for the honor cordon upon departure is basically the same as that\\nfor arrival, except the cordon commander and the senior sergeant position themselves on the\\n12-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Honor Guards\\nflank of the formation away from the departure site. At the approach (about three steps) of the\\nhonored guest(s) and host, the cordon commander commands Present, ARMS, and the\\ncordon salutes simultaneously. After the honored guest has entered the conveyance, the\\ncordon commander commands Order, ARMS and remains in place until the conveyance has\\ndeparted. If the conveyance is an aircraft, the cordon commander commands Order, ARMS;\\nGuards, FACE, and the guards face toward the cordon commander. The honor cordon departs\\nthe area.\\n\\uf06c When a band and Colors are a part of the arrival or departure ceremonies, they are positioned as\\nshown in figure 12-1 on page 12-4. The band plays appropriate music during the ceremony. The\\norganizational Color is dipped in salute when the honored guest(s) approaches to within six steps.\\nAfter they pass, it is returned to the carry position. As soon as the guest(s) has entered the\\nconveyance during a departure ceremony, the Colors and distinguishing flags depart the area with\\nthe honor cordon.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 12-3Chapter 12\\nFigure 12-1. Honor cordon formations\\n12-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 13\\nRetreats and Reveilles\\nRetreat is a ceremony in which the unit honors the U.S. flag when it is lowered in the\\nevening. This ceremony is conducted at the direction of the unit commanders. The\\ninstallation commander sets the time for sounding retreat. Reveille is a ceremony in\\nwhich a unit honors the U.S. flag as it is raised in the morning. This ceremony is\\nconducted at the direction of the commander. The installation commander sets the time\\nfor sounding reveille. (See appendix I for more information on raising the flag.)\\nSECTION I \u2013 RETREAT\\n13-1. The term \u201cretreat\u201d is taken from the French word \u201cretraite\u201d and refers to the evening ceremony. The\\nbugle call sounded at retreat was first used in the French army and dates to the Crusades. Retreat was sounded\\nat sunset to notify sentries to start challenging until sunrise, and to tell the rank and file to go to their quarters.\\nThe ceremony remains as a tradition. The old Cavalry call \u201cTo the Standard,\u201d in use from about 1835, has\\nbeen replaced by the present call of \u201cTo the Color.\u201d This remains as music honoring the flag as it is lowered\\nin the evening.\\nRETREAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-2. The sequence of events for conducting retreat are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed facing the flag 5 minutes (if possible) before the sounding of retreat. Four\\nminutes before the sounding of retreat, the adjutant or other appointed officer takes their position\\ncentered on and facing the line of troops and commands Battalion, ATTENTION and then\\nParade, REST.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant faces about and executes Parade Rest. On the last note of retreat, the evening gun is\\nfired. The adjutant then comes to Attention, faces about, and commands Battalion, ATTENTION\\nand Present, ARMS so that the unit is at Present Arms when the first note of \u201cTo the Color\u201d or\\nnational anthem is sounded. The adjutant then faces about and executes Present Arms. The\\nadjutant\u2019s Salute is the signal for the band to begin playing \u201cTo the Color.\u201d\\n\\uf06c At the last note of \u201cTo the Color\u201d or the national anthem, the adjutant faces about, commands\\nOrder, ARMS, and then directs TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. Unit commanders render\\nthe Hand Salute. The adjutant returns all Salutes with one Salute. This terminates the retreat\\nformation.\\nNote. When subordinate units stand at retreat, not as a part of a major command, the sequence is\\nthe same except the unit commander gives the commands.\\nCOMMAND RETREAT HISTORY\\n13-3. Command retreat is a ceremony conducted with all members of the command present. Normally, it is\\nconducted by a battalion or larger unit. In the 18th century, command retreat was a daily occurrence, not to\\nhonor the flag but as a signal for units to call the roll as a final accounting before reveille the following\\nmorning.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 13-1Chapter 13\\nCOMMAND RETREAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-4. The sequence of events for conducting command retreat are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed in line formation facing the flag (if possible). Subunits may be in mass\\nformation. Subunits are brought to Attention at the approach of the commander and their staff, or\\nat a predesignated signal.\\n\\uf06c The COT forms their staff in line, takes their position two steps in front of the staff, and marches\\nthem to a position centered on and in front of the line of troops. The COT gives the proper\\ncommands to have themselves and their staff facing the line of troops when halted.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant, as soon as the staff is halted and without command, moves from their position with\\nthe staff to a position midway between the COT and the line of unit commanders. The adjutant\\ncommands REPORT. All unit commanders salute and report in succession from right to left \u201cSir\\nor Ma\u2019am, company all present or accounted for.\u201d The adjutant returns each Salute. The adjutant\\nthen commands Present, ARMS, faces about, Salutes, and reports to the COT \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all\\npresent or accounted for.\u201d\\n\\uf06c The COT returns the Salute and directs POST. The adjutant moves to their position with the staff.\\nThe COT commands Order, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c The left flank member of the staff gives the commands to move the staff from behind the COT to\\na position two steps in front of the COT. The COT commands Parade, REST. If a band or field\\nmusic is to be used, the commander comes to Attention at the appointed time and commands\\nSOUND RETREAT. They then return to Parade Rest.\\n\\uf06c On the last note of \u201cRetreat,\u201d the evening gun is fired and the COT commands Battalion,\\nATTENTION and Present, ARMS. The COT then executes About Face and commands\\nthemselves and their staff to Present, ARMS. The commander\u2019s Salute is the signal for the band\\nto begin playing \u201cTo the Color\u201d or the national anthem as the flag is lowered.\\n\\uf06c After the last note of music, the COT commands themselves and their staff to Order, ARMS,\\nfaces about, commands Order, ARMS and directs TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. The\\nunit commanders render the Hand Salute. The COT returns all Salutes with one Salute. The COT\\nthen marches their staff away or dismisses them.\\nSECTION II \u2013 REVEILLE\\n13-5. Reveille was not originally intended as honors to the flag. In 1812, it was a drum call to signify that\\nSoldiers should rise for day duty and sentries should leave off night challenging. As time passed, reveille\\ncame to denote when the flag was raised in the morning and honors paid to it.\\nREVEILLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-6. The sequence of events for conducting reveille are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed facing the flag 5 minutes (if possible) before the sounding of reveille. Four\\nminutes before the sounding of reveille, the adjutant or other appointed officer (normally the duty\\nofficer) takes their position centered on the line of troops, commands the unit to ATTENTION,\\nand commands REPORT.\\n\\uf06c All subunits (companies, batteries, or troops) report in succession from right to left, \u201cSir or\\nMa\u2019am, _____ Company, all present or accounted for,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, _____ Company,\\n____ Soldiers absent.\u201d Salutes are exchanged with each report.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant commands Parade, REST and then assumes Parade Rest themselves. If a band is\\npresent, about 30 seconds before reveille, the adjutant commands ATTENTION, directs SOUND\\nREVEILLE, commands Present, ARMS, and then faces about. The adjutant\u2019s Salute is the signal\\nfor the band to sound reveille and to fire the morning gun. When reveille is sounded by a recording,\\nthe call ATTENTION is sounded about 30 seconds before reveille. This ensures that the adjutant\\nhas sufficient time to command the units to Present, ARMS before the first note of reveille.\\n13-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Retreats and Reveilles\\n\\uf06c After the last note of reveille has sounded, the adjutant terminates their Salute, faces about,\\ncommands Order, ARMS, and then directs TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. The adjutant\\nreturns all Salutes with one Salute. This terminates the ceremony.\\nNote. When a unit conducts the reveille ceremony not as a member of a major command, battalion,\\nor company, the sequence of events remains the same except the unit commander gives all\\ncommands.\\nCOMMAND REVEILLE HISTORY\\n13-7. Command reveille is conducted with all members of the command present. Normally, command\\nreveille is conducted by a battalion or larger unit. Command reveille was conducted as a troop in 1812 and\\nwas used to muster the unit or for roll call.\\nCOMMAND REVEILLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-8. The sequence of events for conducting command reveille are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed in a line formation facing the flag, if possible. Subunits may be in mass\\nformation. Subunits are commanded to Attention at the approach of the commander and their staff.\\n\\uf06c The COT takes their post two steps in front of and centered on their staff, commands Forward,\\nMARCH, and marches their staff to a position centered on and in front of the line of troops. The\\nCOT gives the proper commands to halt their staff in a position facing the line of troops.\\n\\uf06c As soon as the staff is halted by the COT, the adjutant moves (without command) from their\\nposition with the staff to a position midway between the COT and the line of unit commanders.\\nThe adjutant commands Present, ARMS, faces the COT, salutes, and reports \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the\\nbattalion (brigade) is formed.\u201d\\n\\uf06c The COT returns the Salute and directs the adjutant to receive the reports. The adjutant faces about\\nand commands Order, ARMS and REPORT.\\n\\uf06c Unit commanders salute and report, in succession from right to left, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, ____\\nCompany, all present or accounted for.\u201d The adjutant returns each unit commander\u2019s Salute.\\nAfter all unit commanders have reported, the adjutant faces the COT, salutes, and reports \u201cSir or\\nMa\u2019am, all present or accounted for.\u201d The COT returns the Salute and directs the adjutant to\\npublish the orders.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant faces about without saluting and commands ATTENTION TO ORDERS. The\\nadjutant then reads any orders or makes any announcements the COT wishes to publish. The\\nadjutant, on completion of the publishing of orders, faces about and takes their post with the staff\\nwithout saluting.\\n\\uf06c When the adjutant is in position, the left flank staff member commands Right, FACE; Forward,\\nMARCH; Column Left, MARCH; Column Left, MARCH. When the staff is centered on the\\nCOT, they then command Staff, HALT; Left, FACE. About 30 seconds before the sounding of\\nreveille, the COT commands Present, ARMS, executes About Face and commands Staff, Present,\\nARMS. Reveille is then sounded either by record, field music, or band as the flag is raised.\\n\\uf06c At the first note of \u201cReveille,\u201d the morning gun is fired. After the last note of music, the COT\\ncommands Staff, Order, ARMS, executes About Face, and commands Order, ARMS; they then\\ndirect, TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. The unit commanders salute. The COT returns all\\nSalutes with one Salute. They then march their staff away or dismiss them. This terminates the\\nceremony.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 13-3This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 14\\nFunerals\\nThe funerals of Soldiers, more than any other ceremony, have followed an old pattern\\nas the living honor the brave dead. Military funeral honors reflects the high regard and\\nrespect accorded to military service and demonstrates military professionalism to the\\nNation. Military funeral honors is how the Soldiers and leaders of this great Nation\\nshow their gratitude for those who faithfully defended this country, during times of\\nboth war and peace.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n14-1. Funeral services of great magnificence evolved as custom (from what is known about early Christian\\nmourning) in the 6th century. To this day, no religious ceremonies are conducted with more pomp than those\\nintended to commemorate the departed.\\n14-2. The first general mourning proclaimed in America was on the death of Benjamin Franklin in 1791.\\nThe second was the death of George Washington in 1799. The deep and widespread grief occasioned by the\\ndeath of the first President assembled a great number of people for the purpose of paying him a last tribute\\nof respect. On 18 December 1799 attended by military honors and the simplest but grandest ceremonies of\\nreligion, his body was deposited in the family vault at Mount Vernon, Virginia.\\n14-3. Several military traditions employed today have been brought forward from the past:\\n\\uf06c Reversed arms, displayed by one opponent on the battlefield, signaled that a truce was requested\\nso that the dead and wounded could be carried off and the dead buried.\\n\\uf06c Today\u2019s customary three volleys fired over a grave probably originated as far back as the Roman\\nEmpire. The Roman funeral rites of casting dirt three times on the coffin constituted the \u201cburial.\u201d\\nIt was customary among the Romans to call the dead three times by name, which ended the funeral\\nceremony, after which the friends and relatives of the deceased pronounced the word \u201cvale\u201d\\n(farewell) three times as they departed from the tomb. In more recent history, three musket volleys\\nwere fired to announce that the burying of the dead was completed and the burial party was ready\\nfor battle again.\\n\\uf06c The custom of using a caisson to carry a coffin most likely had its origins in the 1800s when\\nhorse-drawn caissons that pulled artillery pieces also doubled as a conveyance to clear fallen\\nSoldiers from the battlefield.\\n\\uf06c In the mid to late 1800s a funeral procession of a mounted officer or enlisted Service member was\\naccompanied by a riderless horse in mourning caparison followed by a hearse. It was also a custom\\nto have the boots of the deceased thrown over the saddle with heels to the front signifying that\\ntheir march was ended.\\nSECTION II \u2013 GENERAL INFORMATION\\n14-4. Military funerals have been an Army requirement for quite some time, and rightfully so. Military\\nmembers have honorably served their country and have perished in the defense of the Nation, or later on in\\nlife. The service and commitment to the country and their sacrifices are acknowledged by dedicating\\nresources and personnel to assist in the funeral or graveside ceremony and provide burial honors. Soldiers on\\nactive duty status, retirees, and Medal of Honor recipients receive a highly trained and dedicated nine-person\\ndetail to provide burial support and honors. Veterans receive a minimum of a two military personnel detail\\nto fold and present a folded American flag to the next of kin (NOK), and a bugler to play \u201cTaps\u201d at the\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-1Chapter 14\\ngravesite ceremony. Special circumstances may require a special full honor detail with more dedicated\\nresources and personnel.\\n14-5. Every funeral service is going to be different and the funeral honor team\u2019s requirement are going to\\ncontinually change with each funeral. The funeral director, the family or person authorized to direct\\ndisposition of human remains (PADD), the casualty assistance officer (known as CAO), and the chaplain or\\nclergy are all going to coordinate the funeral ceremony for a fallen Soldier and family member and they are\\nall going to have certain requests. The full honor detail requires the team to salute the fallen upon arrival,\\ncarry the casket or urn to the gravesite, have the chaplain participate in final words and remarks, salute the\\nfallen once again, fire three-round volley, play \u201cTaps,\u201d fold flag, and present flag to NOK. The two-person\\ndetail will, at a minimum, salute the fallen upon entering the gravesite or final resting place, play \u201cTaps,\u201d\\nfold and then present Color to NOK or PADD.\\nNote. The acronym NCOIC is used when discussing the role for the noncommissioned officer in\\ncharge of the funeral honor team. Sometimes that role will be filled by an officer in charge (OIC),\\nbut for simplicity and clarity we will use the term NCOIC throughout this chapter.\\n14-6. Funeral detail NCOICs will develop their own unit funeral detail standard operating procedures (SOPs)\\nmeeting the minimum Soldier requirements, and then be certified by their unit CSM. The detail NCOIC will\\ntrain their team to conduct all aspects of the funeral team\u2019s functions flawlessly. Every gravesite is going to\\nbe different just like every chapel, but it is the fundamentals that the honor team must get right. Each separate\\ndetail team (pallbearers, firing team, bugler, flag folders, and NCOIC) must know the procedures and conduct\\nthem as accurately and flawlessly as possible. The firing party must move as one, fire as one, stack weapons\\nwith everyone being in sync with one another. The flag must be folded and presented perfectly. The presenter\\nmust memorize and rehearse their tasks until it becomes second nature to them. The goal of the funeral honor\\nteam is to provide military burial honors as prestigiously and gracefully as possible.\\n14-7. The firing detail will be between five and eight personnel with one of the detail members giving\\ncommands and acting as the firing party NCOIC. If the unit SOP establishes five firers for each funeral team\\nwith one NCOIC, then there are six people for pallbearer duties if a separate detail is not provided. The\\nfuneral detail NCOIC must be the one to determine the best way to provide gravesite honors and then rehearse\\nand practice their functions until it becomes muscle memory.\\nINDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES\\n14-8. The Casualty Assistance Center (known as CAC) coordinates burial honors, for deceased Army\\npersonnel, including active duty and retired personnel as well as eligible RCs and veterans when requested\\nby the family. Active duty Soldiers and retirees will receive burial with full military funeral honors, provided\\nby a nine-person funeral detail as described in paragraph 14-20. Eligible members of the RC and veterans\\nwill also receive funeral honors from a two-person detail. Medal of Honor recipients are entitled to full\\nmilitary funeral honors, regardless of status.\\n14-9. The command or activity responsible for providing military funeral honors will ensure there is an active\\nsearch for a bugler (see AR 600-25). A live bugler is preferred for all active duty and veteran funeral services;\\nevery effort must be made to obtain a live bugler to play \u201cTaps\u201d (see AR 600-25). However, if a live bugler\\nis unavailable \u201cTaps\u201d may be played on a ceremonial bugle which is a suitable electronic device. Electronic\\ndevices are only used as a last resort. For assistance searching for a live bugler visit the U.S. Army Bands\\nwebsite. The family of the deceased (or its representative) may request another clergyman to officiate in lieu\\nof a military chaplain. A civilian clergyman can conduct all religious elements of a military funeral or\\ninterment. More information about religious support to funerals and memorial events can be found in\\nATP 1-05.02.\\n14-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n14-10. The desires of the family are given the fullest consideration possible in the selection of elements\\ninvolved, but the funeral is conducted as prescribed in this manual.

The commanding officer or their representative, in coordination with the\\nPADD, cemetery superintendent, and the funeral director makes the funeral arrangements and\\nsupervises the conduct of the funeral.\\nPERSONAL CONDUCT\\n14-11. When honorary pallbearers are desired, they are selected by the family of the deceased, or its\\nrepresentative, or by the commanding officer if the family wishes. As a rule, no more than 12 honorary\\npallbearers should be selected.\\n14-12. At a military funeral, persons in military uniform attending in their individual capacity face the\\ncasket and execute the Hand Salute at the following times: when honors, if any, are sounded; at any time the\\ncasket is being moved as seen in figure 14-1 (unless the uniformed persons are walking); during cannon\\nsalutes, if sounded; during the firing of volleys; and while \u201cTaps\u201d is being played:\\n\\uf06c Honorary pallbearers in uniform conform to those instructions when not in motion.\\n\\uf06c Military personnel in civilian clothes in the above cases, and during the service at the grave, stand\\nat Attention, uncover, and hold the headdress over the left shoulder with the right hand over the\\nheart.

During the religious graveside service, all personnel bow their heads at the words \u201cLet us pray\u201d for\\nacknowledgment of religious activities. Those choosing to pray could pray as they choose. All mourners at\\ngraveside, except the active pallbearers, follow the example of the officiating chaplain. If the chaplain\\nuncovers, they uncover; if the chaplain remains covered, they remain covered. When the officiating chaplain\\nwears a biretta (clerical headpiece) during the graveside service, all personnel, as indicated above, uncover.\\nWhen the officiating chaplain wears a yarmulke (Jewish skull cap), all personnel remain covered.\\n14-14. The remains of a member of the armed forces who died while on active duty may be consigned\\ndirectly to a national cemetery from a military installation. In such cases, the cemetery superintendent will,\\nregardless of time of arrival, if not otherwise provided for, engage a funeral director to receive the remains\\nat the common carrier terminal, hold the remains at their establishment until the date of the funeral, if\\nnecessary, and deliver the remains to the cemetery. The superintendent will not authorize a funeral director\\nto render any other service incident to the interment.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-5Chapter 14\\n14-15. The word \u201cchapel\u201d is interpreted to include the church, home, or other place where services are held,\\nother than the service at the grave. The word \u201ccasket\u201d is interpreted to include the receptacle containing the\\ncremated remains of the deceased.\\nPRESENTATION OF THE FLAG\\n14-16. Funeral honors ceremonies conducted by the Army will use the standardized DOD language for the\\npresentation of the flag to the designated flag recipient. The verbiage below will be used when presenting the\\nU.S. flag during the funeral service. The Service member presenting the flag to NOK of the eligible\\nbeneficiary will be from the parent Service branch and oversee the burial honor team.\\nUse when presenting the U.S. flag during the funeral service:\\n\u201cOn behalf of the President of the United States, (the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine\\nCorps, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, or the U.S. Coast Guard), and a grateful\\nNation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one\\'s\\nhonorable and faithful service.\u201d\\n14-17. In some situations, there will be more than one family member to be presented the American flag\\nduring the gravesite service and the NCOIC will use the CAO or military chaplain to provide the secondary\\nfolded flag to the NCOIC for presentation. The NCOIC will coordinate with the CAO or military chaplain to\\nmove to their location, face each other, salute as mentioned later in this chapter, and then present the flag to\\nthe next individual.\\nSECTION III \u2013 TYPES OF HONORS AND CLASSES OF MILITARY FUNERALS\\n14-18. Military funerals are divided into two classes: chapel service, followed by movement to the grave or\\nplace of local disposition with the prescribed escort; and graveside service only. Chapel service may not be\\nrequested by the funeral director or PADD, but they may request military honors done graveside then funeral\\nhonor teams will only have to perform their duties at the gravesite.\\nTYPES OF MILITARY FUNERAL HONORS\\n14-19. The Army will either provide full honors with a minimum of a nine-Soldier detail team, or veteran\\nhonors with a minimum of a two-person detail. Circumstances sometimes require a special full honor detail\\nto be assembled for a military funeral. Burial honors and the composition of funeral escorts are described in\\nchapter 7 of AR 600-25.\\nFULL HONORS (NINE-SOLDIER DETAIL)\\n14-20. Full military honors are rendered in the event of the death of a Soldier on active duty, retirees, and\\nMedal of Honor recipients (regardless of status). Full military funeral honors consist of a nine-Soldier detail\\nled by an NCOIC (with the appropriate rank and branch of the deceased), six Soldiers to act as pallbearers\\nand conduct firing party duties (dual function), a bugler, and a military chaplain.\\n14-21. The funeral detail NCOIC makes all coordination with the CAC and makes all necessary\\narrangements with the members of the funeral detail. The pallbearers are responsible for the carrying of the\\ncasket from the hearse to the location of the ceremony, and to the burial site, when requested. The pallbearers\\ncould serve in a dual function role responsible to act as the firing party during full military honors, when\\nneeded. The bugler is responsible for the playing of \u201cTaps\u201d during the burial site ceremony, at the conclusion\\nof the benediction later discussed in this chapter. If resources permit, a larger funeral detail may be provided,\\nwhich is composed of all the elements of the nine-person funeral detail, and may also include the following:\\n\\uf06c Color guard.\\n\\uf06c Separate firing party (no more than eight, or less than five rifle-bearers).\\n14-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n\\uf06c Hearse (caisson).\\n\\uf06c Honorary pallbearers.\\n\\uf06c Personal Colors (if appropriate).\\n\\uf06c Escort unit(s) (appropriate for the rank of the deceased).\\nVETERANS HONORS (TWO-PERSON DETAIL)\\n14-22. A two-person detail consists of an OIC or NCOIC (appropriate for the rank of the deceased), an\\nenlisted Soldier, and a bugler to play \u201cTaps.\u201d The two-person military funeral honor team performs flag\\nfolding and flag presentation to NOK, or designated personnel for a deceased military veteran. The flag will\\nbe presented by a member of the veteran\\'s branch of service and that member is overall in charge of the honor\\nteam. \u201cTaps\u201d will be played by a live bugler or an additional detail member using an electronic device. If no\\nbugler is obtained prior to the funeral ceremony then coordination will be done to use an electronic recording.\\nSPECIAL FULL HONOR TEAMS (TWENTY-ONE SOLDIER DETAIL)\\n14-23. Special full honor teams are often composed for special circumstance or when Army leadership are\\ntasked or compelled to provide additional honor ceremony support for situations such as the death of a Soldier\\nkilled in action, general officer, and CSM or sergeant major. Special full honor teams will often be led by\\nsenior NCOs, have more personnel and support provided by the tasked unit, and have senior leaders in\\nattendance. The person who presents the flag to NOK or PADD must be the same rank or higher than the\\nSoldier or veteran being laid to rest.\\n14-24. Special full honor teams could be assembled with escorts, Color guards, pallbearers, firing detail,\\nand band personnel. Special full honor ceremonies could have flyovers depending if the Soldier or veteran\\nbeing laid to rest meets the criteria established in AR 600-25. Special full honors are sometimes a significant\\nevent possibly covered by local and national media organizations.\\n14-25. Special full honors for a general officer in active service will require at the gravesite service a\\nseven-person firing party with one NCOIC to fire the three-round volley. General officers will also have a\\ncannon salute prior to the final benediction with the number of rounds prescribed in AR 600-25, table 3-1.\\nCLASSES OF MILITARY FUNERALS\\n14-26. Military funerals are divided into two classes: chapel service, followed by movement to the grave or\\nplace of local disposition with the prescribed escort; and graveside service only. This manual will provide\\nthe procedures for each class of military funerals with two different types (full military honors and veteran\\nhonors).\\nFUNERAL WITH CHAPEL SERVICE (FULL MILITARY HONORS\u2014NINE-PERSON FUNERAL\\nHONORS DETAIL)\\n14-27. Use the following procedures to conduct a funeral in a chapel with full military honors. Most military\\nhonor teams will not have separate pallbearers and firing party so if the family wants Soldiers to serve as\\npallbearers than the honor team will have a dual function role. This manual will address both funeral team\\nconfigurations. Many funeral homes have a chapel on location and the funeral detail NCOIC will need to\\ncoordinate with the funeral director of their involvement at the service. The following is conducted at the\\nchapel if the Service member is being brought to the chapel from another location, or their presence and\\nservice is requested to carry the deceased from the chapel at the conclusion of the chapel service:\\n\\uf06c At the chapel, the funeral detail forms as shown in figure 14-2 on page 14-8. The NCOIC has all\\nparticipants at the position of Parade Rest. The NCOIC and the pallbearers will be on line at\\nnormal intervals facing the chapel and close to the designated arrival point of the conveyance. The\\nNCOIC positions themselves at the end of the pallbearers so that the conveyance passes them first\\nas it approaches.\\n\\uf06c If resources permit and there is a separate firing party, then the firing party will form two ranks\\nfacing each other and form an aisle from the conveyance to the entrance of the chapel.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-7Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-2. Funeral detail formation\\n\\uf06c Members of the immediate family, relatives, friends of the deceased, and the CAO will be seated\\nin the chapel before the conveyance arrives and the casket is taken into the chapel. Members of\\nthe immediate family and relatives occupy pews (seats) to the right (front) of the chapel or where\\ndesignated from the funeral director.\\n\\uf06c As the conveyance comes into view, the funeral detail NCOIC will command the pallbearers to\\nATTENTION and render a solo hand salute as the conveyance approaches. Once the conveyance\\nstops in front of the chapel, the NCOIC will automatically Order Arms\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 If a separate firing party exists, the funeral detail NCOIC addresses the entire detail and\\ncommands Escort, ATTENTION; Pallbearers, Center, FACE. On the command Center,\\nFACE, just the pallbearers face the designated arrival point of the conveyance (see\\nfigure 14-2).\\n\\uf0a7 As the conveyance approaches, the NCOIC commands Present, ARMS and salutes to honor\\nthe national Color draped over the casket, and commands Order, ARMS after the conveyance\\nhalts.\\n14-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n\\uf06c If necessary, the NCOIC repositions the pallbearers at the rear of the conveyance as seen in\\nfigure 14-3.\\n\\uf06c After the funeral director opens the doors of the hearse, the NCOIC Present Arms until the casket\\nenters the chapel:\\n\\uf0a7 If a firing party is present, they will also Present Arms as the door to the hearse is open.\\n\\uf0a7 The firing party will remain in Present Arms until the NCOIC commands Order, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c The senior pallbearer, designated position 5, and the pallbearer in position 1 grasp the handles at\\nthe head of the casket. (The union of the flag is draped over this end.) They walk backwards,\\npulling the casket from the conveyance, allowing the pallbearers in positions 2 and 3 to grasp\\nhandles on the casket. The pallbearers handle the remains in a dignified, reverent, and military\\nmanner, ensuring the casket is carried level and feet first at all times (see figure 14-1 on page 14-5).\\nFigure 14-3. Carrying the casket inside\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-9Chapter 14\\n\\uf06c For funerals where there is a separate firing party, once the casket is borne between the firing party\\nmembers, and taken into the chapel, the NCOIC commands Order, ARMS. The firing party\\ndeparts under the control of the firing party commander and travels to the gravesite if\\ntransportation is available. Once at the gravesite, the firing party prepares for the gravesite\\nceremony. The bugler, if not already at the gravesite, travels with the firing party.\\n\\uf06c Having entered the chapel, the pallbearers carry the casket to the front of the church. If a church\\ntruck is available, the casket is placed on the truck at the entrance of the chapel and pushed to the\\nfront by the senior pallbearer and one other. The pallbearers then take seats, as directed by the\\nchaplain, until the conclusion of the chapel service.\\n\\uf06c For information on how to display the U.S. flag on the casket, either closed or half-couch, consult\\nDA Pam 638-2, appendix E.\\n\\uf06c After the service, the pallbearers either carry the casket or push it on a church truck from the front\\nof the chapel to the exit. The casket is placed directly into the conveyance with the senior and\\nnumber 1 pallbearers being the last to release their casket handles. The funeral director secures the\\ndoors of the conveyance.\\n\\uf06c The pallbearers board their transportation and travel to the interment site to prepare for the\\ngraveside ceremony. The funeral party travels in the following order (see figure 14-4):\\n\\uf0a7 Clergy.\\n\\uf0a7 Conveyance with casket.\\n\\uf0a7 Active pallbearers.\\n\\uf0a7 Personal flag (if appropriate).\\n\\uf0a7 Family and CAO.\\n\\uf0a7 Friends.\\nNote. The funeral detail will need to swiftly move directly to the gravesite to establish where to\\nplace the firing party or to stack weapons if the firing party is performing a dual function as the\\npallbearers. The NCOIC will place the bugler, and then prepare the detail to perform their gravesite\\nduties. The funeral detail NCOIC must know the exact location of the cemetery and gravesite to\\neliminate the possibilities of issues.\\n14-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nFigure 14-4. Funeral procession\\n\\uf06c After the procession is formed, it travels directly to the gravesite. Upon arrival, the funeral detail\\nNCOIC positions themselves between the chaplain and the head of the gravesite. The pallbearers\\nform and remove the casket from the conveyance the same as previously outlined (see figure 14-5\\non page 14-12).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-11Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-5. Graveside formation\\n\\uf06c Once the casket is removed from the conveyance, the NCOIC commands the firing party (if\\nresources permit a separate firing party) and bugler to Present Arms.\\n\\uf06c The pallbearers carry the casket, feet first, to the grave. Upon reaching the grave, the casket is\\nplaced on the lowering device. The pallbearers then execute the appropriate facing movement and\\nmarch off in two ranks toward the designated firing party location if they are conducting dual\\nfunctions. While marching, the pallbearers merge into single file in order to form one rank,\\n45 degrees off the foot of the casket. The firing party commander is positioned on the opposite\\nflank or centered to the rear of the formation (see figure 14-6 on page 14-14). At that time, the\\n14-12 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nfiring party commander will command the firing party to unstack their weapons, which have been\\npre-positioned under guard at the gravesite, and then to stand at Parade Rest during the gravesite\\nservice:\\n\\uf0a7 If there is a separate firing party, then the pallbearers will move to a predesignated location\\nto observe the funeral ceremony.\\n\\uf0a7 The pallbearers will stand at parade rest until the three-round volley and the playing of \u201cTaps.\u201d\\n\\uf06c When the casket is placed over the grave, and the pallbearers march from the casket to become\\nthe firing party or spectators, the NCOIC terminates their salute and moves from their place at the\\nhead of the casket in order to permit the chaplain to conduct the graveside service. The NCOIC\\nshould move to a location where they still face the family but does not interfere with the service.\\nOnce in position, they assume the position of Parade Rest until the service is completed.\\n\\uf06c After Parade Rest has been commanded, the chaplain conducts the graveside service. At the\\nconclusion of the benediction, the NCOIC returns to their position at the head of the casket, renders\\na hand salute, which also cues the firing party commander to commence the firing party sequence,\\nas outlined in paragraph 14-40. The CAO and other military members in attendance also execute\\nPresent Arms. The firing party fires three volleys of blank cartridges, assumes the position of\\nPresent Arms at the command of the firing party commander, and remains in this position until\\nthe conclusion of \u201cTaps.\u201d The bugler, positioned near the firing party and in view of NOK, sounds\\n\u201cTaps\u201d immediately following the firing party assuming Present Arms.\\n\\uf06c At the conclusion of \u201cTaps,\u201d the firing party comes to Order Arms at the command of the firing\\nparty commander, and if they are performing a dual function they restack their weapons in a\\nceremonial manner. After the stacking of weapons is completed, the firing party forms into two\\nranks and marches in the most direct route back to the lowering device platform so they can\\nperform the ceremonial foldin'", "tokenizer": "<Encoding 'gpt2'>", "max_length": "256", "stride": "256"}, "time": 1717698421.0987904}
