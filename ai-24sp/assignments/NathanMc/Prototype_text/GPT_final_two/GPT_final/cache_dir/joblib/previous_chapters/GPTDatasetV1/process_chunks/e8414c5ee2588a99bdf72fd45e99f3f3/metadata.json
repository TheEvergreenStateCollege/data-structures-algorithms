For a funeral without chapel service, all elements of a military funeral are present and used as\\npreviously described in paragraph 14-27. However, if troops are not conveniently available, or if the family\\nwishes to eliminate other elements, the following are used (see figure 14-8 on page 14-16):\\n\\uf06c Military clergy (if available and requested).\\n\\uf06c OIC or NCOIC, appropriate to the grade of the deceased (see AR 600-25).\\n\\uf06c Active pallbearers or firing party.\\n\\uf06c Separate firing party (if resources permit).\\n\\uf06c Bugler.\\n\\uf06c Personal Color bearer (if appropriate).\\nNote.

Graveside service\\nVETERANS HONORS AT GRAVESIDE SERVICE (TWO-PERSON DETAIL)\\n14-29. A two-person honor detail provides graveside honors by the playing of \u201cTaps\u201d and the flag folding\\nand presentation to the appropriate family members. If a live bugler is unavailable, the designated person\\nresponsible for the funeral honors may authorize instead the playing of a recording of \u201cTaps\u201d and will ensure\\nthat a quality recording is available (see AR 600-25). If a live bugler is not available then an additional detail\\nmember will be needed to play \u201cTaps.\u201d That bugler will need to acquire a bugle, two sets of batteries, and an\\nextra flag to use during the ceremony if the funeral director did not get one. The use of an alternative\\nelectronic device is authorized although highly discouraged. Use the following procedures to conduct a\\nmilitary funeral with a two-person honor detail:\\n\\uf06c Once the Army CAC is alerted, it arranges for the two-person military honor detail to arrive at the\\ninterment site at the appropriate time to provide graveside honors:\\n\\uf0a7 The leader of the detail has many responsibilities to include contacting the funeral director to\\nconfirm the date, time, and location of the interment service. The leader ensures that the\\nfuneral director has obtained a flag for the ceremony. The detail leader will bring a backup\\nflag to the ceremony in case it is needed.\\n\\uf0a7 The leader confirms and coordinates participation of the second member of the detail.\\n\\uf0a7 When all coordination is completed, the final pre-interment activity is to train and rehearse\\nthe detail. A mandatory training item is to carefully watch a video demonstration tape\\nprovided by DOD to each installation.\\n\\uf0a7 On the day of the interment ceremony, the detail leader confirms arrangements with the\\nfuneral director and coordinates necessary cues at the interment site.\\n14-16 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n\\uf0a7 The two-person detail will line up on the curbside with their backs towards the gravesite, side\\nby side.\\n\\uf06c The rendition of \u201cTaps\u201d may be by performed by a bugler or by an electronic device:\\n\\uf0a7 The CAC actively searches for a bugler (military or civilian). Bugler support may be from an\\nArmy band (Active or RC), contracted, or voluntary.\\n\\uf0a7 If a live bugler is not available, an additional person will have to perform the role as a bugler\\nusing a digital bugle. The CAC issues a digital bugle that plays a prerecorded \u201cTaps.\u201d Ensure\\nthe bugle has two sets of batteries.\\n\\uf0a7 The person playing the bugle should use the same precision that an Army bugler is trained to\\nperform. See TC 1-19.10, appendix F, for the proper way to hold the instrument and how to\\nexecute the manual of instruments.\\n\\uf0a7 If a bugler is not available, the CAC uses the high-quality recording of the U.S. Army Band\\nbugler provided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense on CD. Many national and private\\ncemeteries have sound systems that play \u201cTaps\u201d at the interment site. However, CACs cannot\\nassume availability of such systems and must have enough high-quality, portable CD players\\nto provide their own sound system at funerals. (A portable CD player that can be easily heard\\nby all attendees at the interment ceremony is recommended.) Before departing for a funeral,\\nthe detail leader must determine if a sound system is available or if the CAC must provide a\\nsound system to the honors detail.\\n\\uf06c The detail arrives at the interment site early and conducts a reconnaissance and rehearsal. Part of\\nthe reconnaissance is the selection of a location for the bugler or CD player that will sound \u201cTaps.\u201d\\nThe detail leader sets up and tests the CD player, ensuring the unit and its remote controls are\\nworking properly and that it is out of sight of the family:\\n\\uf0a7 When everything is prepared, the detail leader positions the detail in their designated place\\nbefore the arrival of the funeral cortege. The detail leader positions themselves near the\\nrecording device; the other members(s) will be positioned near the foot of the grave.\\n\\uf0a7 The leader brings the team to Attention and Present Arms as the remains are carried to the\\ngravesite by civilian pallbearers. The detail leader commands Order, ARMS when the casket\\nis placed on the lowering device.\\n\\uf0a7 At the conclusion of the committal service, the detail leader directs the bugler to sound \u201cTaps\u201d\\nelectronically. Installations must ensure that honor detail training directs that the digital bugle\\nmovements are executed to Army bands military occupational specialty standard, or the\\nrecording device be positioned out of sight of the family and be played in a dignified manner\\nas shown in the training video from DOD.\\n\\uf0a7 The person playing the digital bugle should use the same precision that an Army band bugler\\nis trained to perform. See TC 1-19.10, appendix F, for the proper way to hold the instrument\\nand how to execute the manual of instruments.\\n\\uf0a7 Although the CD player should be out of sight, activating the \u201cplay\u201d button should be\\nperformed with precision and distinction by bending over, activating the recorder, and then\\nstepping back one step and assuming the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf0a7 Each detail member will Present Arms during \u201cTaps\u201d and will execute Order Arms at its\\ncompletion. At the conclusion of \u201cTaps,\u201d the detail leader ensures the recording device is\\nturned off and then proceeds in a dignified and military manner to the head of the casket.\\n\\uf06c For flag folding, upon conclusion of \u201cTaps,\u201d the representative and their assistant move closer to\\nthe casket. When the flag is secured and raised, the detail takes three steps away from the mourners\\nand folds the flag. (See appendix I for detailed information on folding the flag.) When the flag is\\nproperly folded, the detail leader inspects and then salutes the flag for 3 seconds. The assistant\\nhands the flag to the detail leader, salutes the flag for 3 seconds, and posts to a position next to the\\nside or rear of the family.\\n\\uf06c After the assistant departs, the detail leader presents the flag to NOK using the following wording:\\n\u201cOn behalf of the President of the United States, the United States Army, and a grateful Nation,\\nplease accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one\u2019s honorable and faithful\\nservice.\u201d After presenting the flag, the detail leader moves to the Position of Attention and\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-17Chapter 14\\nconducts a slow salute to the flag. They then execute a facing movement and march out of sight\\nfrom the funeral ceremony. Presentation of the flag is previously discussed on pages 14-14 and\\n14-15.\\n\\uf06c Not all funerals will be authorized the human resources as outlined in this sequence of events;\\ntherefore, the NCOIC will extract those portions of the sequence that apply to their funeral detail\\ncontingent.\\n\\uf06c Additions to an element of the funeral detail not specifically addressed in this sequence of events\\nare not authorized. Requests for exceptions to policy will be directed to TRADOC.\\nSECTION IV \u2013 ADDITIONAL FUNERAL CONSIDERATIONS\\n14-30. Funeral details will have many other considerations which will have to be addressed by the NCOIC\\nor OIC. Although each funeral is similar in nature, there are many different events and considerations to be\\naware of. Cremated remains, cannon salutes, and participation of aviation are a few of the funeral\\nconsiderations addressed during the planning and execution of a funeral.\\nCREMATED REMAINS\\n14-31. When the remains are cremated and the ashes interred with military honors, the previously stated\\nprovisions, with necessary modifications, will govern:\\n\\uf06c For all phases of the funeral, where the cremated remains are carried by hand, one pallbearer is\\ndetailed to carry the receptacle (casket) containing the ashes and another is detailed to carry the\\nflag, folded into the shape of a cocked hat. The pallbearer carrying the flag is always positioned\\nto the right of the remains (see figure 14-9). When the receptacle is carried from the hearse into\\nthe chapel and from the chapel to the hearse, these two pallbearers are the only participants in the\\nceremony. During the procession to the gravesite, the receptacle and flag are carried by the two\\npallbearers followed by four additional pallbearers. When the receptacle has been placed on the\\ngravesite, all six pallbearers unfold the flag and hold it over the grave. (Honors are the same as a\\nflag-draped casket.)\\n14-18 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nFigure 14-9. Pallbearers for cremated remains\\n\\uf06c When the receptacle and flag are placed before the chancel of the chapel or transported to gravesite\\nby vehicle, the receptacle and folded flag are placed side by side. If the pallbearers walk to the\\ngravesite, the two bearers who carried the receptacle and the flag join the other four pallbearers\\nalready pre-positioned on either side of the hearse.\\n\\uf06c When no hearse is used, suitable transportation is provided for the receptacle, flag bearers, and the\\nother pallbearers.\\n\\uf06c When the remains are moved to a crematory and the ashes are to be interred with military honors\\nat a later time, the ceremony consists only of the escort to the crematory. All personnel salute as\\nthe remains are carried into the crematory. The firing of volleys and the sounding of \u201cTaps\u201d are\\nomitted. When the funeral ceremony is held at the crematory, and when no further honors are\\nanticipated, the volleys are fired and \u201cTaps\u201d is sounded at the discretion of the commanding\\nofficer.\\nNote. In this situation, the flag is carried left hand over right hand with the point forward.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-19Chapter 14\\nCEREMONY BEFORE SHIPMENT OF REMAINS\\n14-32. When the remains of a deceased Soldier are moved to a railway station or other point for shipment\\nto another place for interment or final disposition, funeral services are modified as necessary. When no further\\nmilitary honors are anticipated at the place of interment or final disposition, the volleys are fired and \u201cTaps\u201d\\nsounded at the discretion of the commanding officer. When military honors are anticipated at the place of\\nfinal disposition, the volleys and \u201cTaps\u201d are omitted.\\nCANNON SALUTE\\n14-33. When the funeral of a general officer on the active or retired list, who was entitled to a cannon salute,\\ntakes place at or near a military installation, guns equal to the number to which the officer was entitled (see\\nAR 600-25) may be fired at noon on the day of the funeral. The military installation mentioned in general\\norders will fire the prescribed salutes. Immediately preceding the benediction, a cannon salute corresponding\\nto the grade of the deceased (see AR 600-25) is fired at 5-second intervals. Following the benediction, three\\nvolleys of musketry are fired.\\nPARTICIPATION OF AVIATION\\n14-34. When aviation participates in a military funeral, it is timed so that the aircraft appear over the\\nprocession. Requirements for aviation participation can be found in AR 600-25.\\nPARTICIPATION OF RESERVE COMPONENTS\\n14-35. The RC, along with the active Army, are required to participate in funeral details. The Army National\\nGuard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) have a single point of contact (POC) in each ARNG state\\narea command (known as STARC) or USAR regional support command (known as RSC) to which a request\\nfor assistance can be made. When the active Army is unable to support the request, or it is more prudent for\\nthe RC unit to provide honors, the CAC contacts the RC POC at either the STARC or RSC for military\\nfuneral honors support. If the RC POC does not respond to the request for support within 2 hours, the CAC\\nshould again contact the RC POC. When the RC is unable to support the request for assistance, the CAC is\\nresponsible for providing the honors. The casualty and memorial affairs operations center, personnel\\ncommand will provide a list of RC POCs to the CACs. CACs should establish memorandums of agreement\\nwith RC POCs and other military organizations within their area of responsibility specifying requirements\\nand responsibilities.\\nPARTICIPATION OF FRATERNAL OR PATRIOTIC\\nORGANIZATIONS\\n14-36. The family or representative of the deceased may request fraternal or patriotic organizations, of\\nwhich the deceased was a member, to take part in the funeral service. With immediate family approval\\nfraternal or patriotic organizations may conduct graveside service at the conclusion of the military portion of\\nthe ceremony, signified by the flag presentation to NOK and escort departure from the cemetery.\\nDUTIES OF THE CHAPLAIN\\n14-37. The chaplain takes their position in front of the chapel before the arrival of the remains. The chaplain\\nprecedes the casket when it is carried from the hearse into the chapel and from the chapel to the hearse. While\\nthe remains are being placed in the hearse, they stand at the rear and to the side facing the hearse. When the\\nchaplain is wearing vestments, they may, at their discretion, proceed from the chancel to the sacristy (vestry)\\nat the conclusion of the chapel service and divest, joining the procession before it moves from the chapel.\\nThe chaplain then precedes the hearse to the graveside and precedes the casket to the grave.\\n14-20 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nPRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS\\n14-38. The OIC of a military funeral, the commander of the escort, the funeral director, and the\\nsuperintendent of the cemetery or their representative visit the places involved and make careful\\narrangements before the time set for the funeral. They determine the positions at the grave for the various\\nelements of the funeral and arrange for traffic control.\\nFLORAL TRIBUTES\\n14-39. In the absence of the chaplain, the chaplain\u2019s assistant helps the funeral director in arranging all\\nfloral tributes in the chapel. The commanding officer or their representative coordinates the necessary\\ntransportation with the funeral director for prompt transfer of floral tributes from the chapel to the gravesite.\\nThe vehicle bearing the floral tributes is loaded promptly at the conclusion of the chapel service. It precedes\\nthe funeral procession, moving as rapidly as practicable to the site of the grave. The funeral procession does\\nnot move from the chapel until the vehicle carrying the floral tributes has cleared the escort. The funeral\\ndirector or the cemetery representative is responsible for removing cards and making a record that gives a\\nbrief description of the floral piece pertaining to each card. After completion of the funeral services, the cards\\nand records are turned over to a member of the family of the deceased.\\nRULES FOR CEREMONIAL FIRING\\n14-40. For ceremonial firing, the firing party consists of not more than eight riflemen and not less than five\\nriflemen with one NCOIC (see figure 14-10 on page 14-22). The firing party is normally pre-positioned at\\nthe gravesite and facing in the direction that allows it to fire directly over the grave. However, care should\\nbe taken to ensure that rifles are fired at a 45-degree angle from the horizontal:\\n\\uf06c To load\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Magazines or clips are loaded with three rounds before forming the firing party.\\n\\uf0a7 At the conclusion of the religious services or on the escort commander\u2019s command, the\\nNCOIC commands With blank ammunition, LOAD. At the command LOAD, each\\nrifle-bearer executes Port Arms, faces to the half right, and moves their right foot 10 inches\\nto the right to a position that gives them a firm, steady stance. The rifle-bearer then chambers\\na round, places the weapon in the safe position, and resumes Port Arms.\\n\\uf06c To fire by volley\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 When the rifle-bearers have completed the movements and the weapons are locked, the\\ncommands from the firing detail NCOIC are Ready, Aim, FIRE. At the command Ready,\\neach rifle-bearer moves the safety to the fire position. On the command Aim, the rifle is\\nshouldered with both hands with the muzzle to the front at an angle of 45 degrees from the\\nhorizontal. On the command of execution FIRE, the trigger is squeezed quickly, and the\\nweapon is immediately returned to Port Arms.\\n\\uf0a7 To continue the firing with weapons that function automatically (blank adapter), the\\ncommands Aim and FIRE are given and executed as previously prescribed. To continue the\\nfiring with weapons that must be manually operated to chamber another round (without blank\\nadapters), the commands Ready, Aim, FIRE are again given. On, the command Ready, each\\nrifle-bearer manually chambers the next round. The commands Aim and FIRE are then given\\nand executed as previously prescribed.\\n\\uf0a7 When the third round has been fired and the riflemen have resumed Port Arms, the NCOIC\\ncommands CEASE FIRING. Every rifle-bearer immediately place their weapon on safe,\\nassume the Position of Attention (at Port Arms), and face to the half left. From this position,\\nthe firing party is commanded to Present Arms before the playing of \u201cTaps.\u201d After \u201cTaps,\u201d\\nthey are commanded to Order Arms. The NCOIC executes a Right (Left) Face and remains\\nat Attention until the flag has been folded and saluted by the NCOIC of the funeral detail. At\\nthis time, the firing party NCOIC executes a Right (Left) Face and commands Right (Left),\\nFACE; Port, ARMS; and Forward, MARCH. At the first halt, the rifles of the firing party\\nare cleared and inspected.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-21Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-10. Position of fire, ceremonial firing\\n14-22 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 15\\nColors\\nFrom the earliest times, warriors used a banner or other symbol to identify specific\\nunits and to serve as a rallying point for troops. In medieval days, the standard or\\nbanner was used to signal a general assault, which was generated by a cry of \u201cAdvance\\nyour banners.\u201d Until comparatively recent years, the flags that identified nations\\nusually were based on the personal or family heraldry of the reigning monarch or ruling\\nnobleman. As autocracies faded or disappeared, dynastic Colors were no longer\\npopular and national flags, as thought of today, came into being. These national flags,\\nsuch as the Union Jack of Great Britain, the TriColor of France, and the Stars and\\nStripes, are relatively new to history.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n15-1. Flags are almost as old as civilization itself. Imperial Egypt as well as the armies of Babylon, Chaldea,\\nand Assyria followed the Colors of their kings. The Old Testament frequently mentions banners and\\nstandards. Many flags of different designs were present in parts of the American Colonies before the\\nRevolution. When the struggle for independence united the Colonies, the colonists wanted a single flag to\\nrepresent the new nation. The first flag borne by the Army as a representative of the Thirteen Colonies was\\nthe Grand Union flag. It was raised over the Continental Army at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 2 January\\n1776. That flag had the familiar 13 stripes (red and white) of the present flag, but the blue square contained\\nthe Crosses of Saint George and Saint Andrew from the British flag.\\n15-2. The Stars and Stripes was born on 14 June 1777, two years to the day after the birth of the Army. On\\nthat date, Congress resolved that the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternate red and white, and that\\nthe union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation. The arrangement of the stars on\\nthe blue field was not specified:\\n\\uf06c According to some historians, the Stars and Stripes was first raised over Fort Stanwix, New York,\\non 3 August 1777. In that Army version of the flag, the stars were arranged in a circle. (The\\nU.S. Navy version had the stars arranged to form crosses similar to the British flag.)\\n\\uf06c When Vermont and Kentucky joined the Union, the flag was modified so that there were 15 stars\\nand 15 stripes. It was that flag, flying triumphantly over Fort McHenry, Maryland, on 13 and 14\\nSeptember 1814, which inspired Francis Scott Key to compose the verses of \u201cThe Star-Spangled\\nBanner.\u201d That flag was the national banner from 1795 until 1818. Thus, when it was raised over\\nTripoli by the Marines in 1805, it was the first U.S. flag to be hoisted over conquered territory in\\nthe Old World. Later, it was flown by General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans.\\n\\uf06c Realizing that adding a stripe for each new state would soon spoil the appearance of the flag,\\nCongress passed a law in 1818 fixing the number of stripes at 13 and providing for the addition of\\na star in the Blue Union for each new state. The star is to be added and the new flag to become\\nofficial on the Fourth of July following the admission of the new state to the Union.\\n\\uf06c It was not until shortly before the Civil War that the Stars and Stripes became the national Color.\\n15-3. Before the Civil War, in lieu of a national Color, U.S. Soldiers carried a blue silk Color on which was\\nembroidered the arms of the United States, and an American eagle bearing a shield on its breast, and in its\\ntalons an olive branch and arrows, signifying peace and war. After the national Color was authorized, the\\norganizational Color with the eagle became the regimental Color. Because of the high casualty rate among\\nthe members of the Color party, plus the advent of modern weapons, the time-honored practice of carrying\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 15-1Chapter 15\\nthe Colors in battle was discontinued. Today, the Colors, with battle streamers attached, join their unit in\\nformations during ceremonies to signify their presence during past battles.\\nSECTION II \u2013 THE COLOR AND COLORS\\n15-4. The national and organizational flags carried by Color-bearing units are called the national Color and\\nthe organizational Color. When used singularly, the term \u201cColor\u201d implies the national Color. The plural term\\n\u201cColors\u201d means the national and positional or organizational Colors. By regulation, the organizational Color\\nis not authorized a Salute; however, in the past some organizations have observed the custom of saluting the\\norganizational Color.\\n15-5. In garrison, the Colors are normally kept at the office or headquarters of the commanding officer. They\\nare escorted to and from the headquarters or office by the Color guard. In the field, the Colors are normally\\ndisplayed from reveille to retreat in front of the commanding officer\u2019s tent or command post. During\\ninclement weather, they are cased and placed in the commanding officer\u2019s office, headquarters, or tent.\\n15-6. Individuals or units passing or being passed by uncased Colors out of doors render honors. Individuals,\\nnot part of a formation, salute six steps distance from the Colors and hold the Salute until they have passed\\nsix steps beyond the Colors. The individual in charge of a formation calls the formation to ATTENTION\\nand Present, ARMS.\\n15-7. The Colors will be carried on all ceremonial occasions when two or more companies, honor guards, or\\nrepresentative elements of a command participate. Traditionally, the CSM is responsible for the safeguarding,\\ncare, and display of the organizational Color. The CSM is also responsible for the selection, training, and\\nperformance of the Color bearers and Color guards.\\n15-8. During a review, parade, or honor guard ceremony, ordinarily only one national Color is present. The\\nnational Color is given the honor position and is carried on the marching right of positional and organizational\\nColors. The U.S. Army flag or the Army field flag (when authorized) is carried to the immediate left of the\\nnational Color. The organizational Color of the senior headquarters sponsoring the ceremony is carried to the\\nleft of the Army flag or field flag, if present. The Colors belonging to the headquarters conducting the\\nceremonies are positioned on line with and centered on the command. Subordinate Color-bearing\\norganizations ordinarily carry only their organizational Colors (four steps to the rear of their staff). The\\nregulation for individual flags and distinguishing flags for general officers and other dignitaries is the same\\nas that for organizational Colors (see AR 840-10).\\n15-9. When the local commander wishes, or considers it more appropriate, they may authorize subordinate\\nColor-bearing organizations to carry their national Color with their organizational Colors behind their staffs.\\nConsideration must be given as to the number of times the spectators will be required to stand during the pass\\nin review. Also, consideration must be given to the frequency of Salutes required by the reviewing officer:\\n\\uf06c Another method in which subordinate Color-bearing units may carry their Colors is to have them\\nparticipate in a massed Colors formation. Because of many complications caused by massed\\nColors, units should prescribe a local SOP governing the desired procedures.\\n\\uf06c Examples of complications include: organizational Colors losing their identity, order of\\nprecedence, resizing of Color guards and bearers, uniformity when the first rank consists of five\\nSoldiers rather than four, and presenting a good appearance when returning to the formation after\\nbeing brought forward while keeping the national Color on the marching right.\\n15-10. When Colors are participating in a ceremony, they will be received and dismissed. Information\\npertaining to Colors participating in a ceremony are described in paragraphs 15-20 and 15-24.\\nSALUTES\\n15-11. The national Color renders no Salute (dip). An exception to this rule is followed by naval vessels\\nwhen, upon receiving a Salute of this type from a vessel registered by a nation formally recognized by the\\nUnited States, the compliment must be returned.\\n15-12. The organizational Color Salutes (dips) in all military ceremonies while the national anthem, \u201cTo\\nthe Color,\u201d or a foreign national anthem is being played, and when rendering honors to the organizational\\n15-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Colors\\ncommander or an individual of higher grade including foreign dignitaries of higher grade, but in no other\\ncase. The U.S. Army flag is considered to be an organizational Color and, as such, is also dipped while the\\nnational anthem, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d or a foreign national anthem is being played, and when rendering honors to\\nthe Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, their direct representative, or an individual of equivalent or higher grade,\\nbut in no other case:\\n\\uf06c When marching, organizational Colors salute when six steps from the person entitled to the Salute.\\n\\uf06c They are returned to the Carry position when six steps beyond the person.\\nCOLOR GUARD\\n15-13. The Color guard consists of two (three) sergeants and two specialists or privates. It is an honor to be\\nselected as a member of the Color guard. The senior (Color) sergeant carries the national Color and\\ncommands the Color guard. The senior (Color) sergeant gives the necessary commands for the movements\\nand for rendering honors. The uniform for Color guards should be the same as prescribed for participating\\ntroops. In addition to the uniform, the Color guard should be provided white polyester dress gloves, uniform\\nneck scarves, and a white, black, or olive drab flag carrier. The flag carrier could be a single or double leather\\nor web strapped harness with a brass or chrome cup.\\n15-14. When battalions or brigades carry their organizational Colors in a ceremony as part of a larger\\ncommand, the battalion or brigade Color is carried four steps to the rear of the staff. A sergeant acts as Color\\nbearer and two experienced specialists or privates, selected by the battalion or brigade CSM, act as members\\nof the Color guard.\\n15-15. The Color guard is formed and Marched in one rank at Close Interval, the bearers in the center. They\\ndo not execute Rear March or About Face. The Color guard marches at Right Shoulder Arms and executes\\nFacing movements by wheeling to the right or left. The command for a Facing movement is Right (Left)\\nWheel, MARCH. To execute a Wheeling movement, the guard nearest the direction of turn serves as the\\npivot point and executes the movement by marching in place and simultaneously turning in the new direction.\\nOther members shorten their steps and turn in an arc keeping abreast of each other to maintain alignment.\\nWhen the movement has been completed, each member automatically marches in place until the command\\nHALT or Forward, MARCH is given.\\n15-16. When passing in review, the Color guard executes Eyes Right at the prescribed saluting distance on\\nthe command of the Color sergeant. The commands are Eyes, RIGHT and Ready, FRONT. The\\norganizational Color salutes at the command RIGHT and resumes the Carry at the command FRONT. The\\nguard on the right flank of the Color guard does not execute Eyes Right.\\n15-17. During ceremonies, the Color guard remains at Right Shoulder Arms except when executing Present\\nArms. When not participating in a ceremony and a situation occurs that warrants a Salute by the\\norganizational Color, the Color sergeant commands Color, SALUTE. The return to the Carry is made at the\\ncommand Carry, COLOR.\\n15-18. When in formation with the Color company, and not during a ceremony, the Color bearers execute\\nAt Ease and Rest, keeping the staffs of the Colors vertical. The Color guard executes Right Shoulder Arms,\\nOrder Arms, and Present Arms with the Color company. During ceremonies when the Colors are not forward\\nand remarks are to be made, the Color guards and Color bearers execute Order Arms and Parade Rest on\\ncommand of the Color company commander. During any ceremony when the units are At Ease, the Color\\nguard and Color bearers are at Parade Rest.\\nRECEIVING OR DISMISSING THE COLORS BY THE COLOR\\nGUARD\\n15-19. The Color guard uses the following procedures when receiving or dismissing the Colors:\\n\\uf06c When receiving uncased Colors on display in the commander\u2019s office, the Color guard is\\npositioned in a single rank facing the Colors. The Color sergeant commands Present, ARMS and\\nOrder, ARMS. On completion of Order Arms, the Color bearers (without command) secure the\\nColors. The Color guard files outside (guard, national Color, organizational Color, guard) and\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 15-3Chapter 15\\nre-forms in a line formation. The Color guards execute Right Shoulder Arms and the Color bearers\\nassume the Carry Position.\\n\\uf06c To dismiss the Colors, the procedures are basically the same except that the Colors are placed\\nback in their stands before executing Present Arms.\\nCASING AND UPCASING THE COLORS\\n15-20. To case and uncase the Colors, the Color guard forms in a line formation with the cased Colors at\\nthe Carry Position (Order Position when indoors). The CSM (or their direct representative) positions\\nthemselves six steps in front of and centered on the formation. They then command Sling, ARMS:\\n\\uf06c The Color guards immediately adjust their slings and assume Sling Arms. The CSM commands\\nPOST. The Color guards face to the Half Left (Right) in marching, take four steps, halt, and\\nexecute About Face.\\n\\uf06c The CSM then directs UNCASE THE COLORS. The Color bearers lower the Colors (same as\\nPresent Guidon). The two guards move forward and untie and uncase the Colors. The Color\\nbearers unfurl and immediately return the Colors to the Carry (Order) Position. While the Colors\\nare being unfurled, the guards fold the cases and secure them in their left hand.\\n\\uf06c When the Colors are in the Carry Position, the CSM commands Present, ARMS. The CSM, Color\\nguards, and the organizational Color Salute.\\n\\uf06c The CSM commands Order, ARMS, and then commands POST. On the command of execution\\nPOST, the Color guards place the folded canvas cases inside the cartridge belts (center rear) of\\nthe Color bearers. The Color guards assume their original positions, adjust their slings, and return\\nto Right Shoulder Arms.\\n\\uf06c If the CSM or their representative is not present, the senior Color sergeant gives the necessary\\ncommands.\\nNote. To case the Colors, the procedures are basically the same except Present Arms is given\\nbefore the Colors are lowered.\\n15-21. When casing or uncasing the Colors with the command present, the commander directs UNCASE\\n(CASE) THE COLORS. The CSM and Color guards execute the movement (as previously stated in\\nparagraph 15-20) except that they execute Present Arms and Order Arms with the Color company. When the\\nColors are uncased and returned to the Carry Position, the commander directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO\\nPRESENT ARMS. After the units have executed this directive, the commander then directs BRING YOUR\\nUNITS TO ORDER ARMS.\\n15-22. If the Colors are to be cased or uncased during the receiving or dismissing by the Color company,\\nthe Color guards execute Present Arms and Order Arms on command of the company commander. The CSM\\nuncases the organizational Color when it is displayed by itself. The CSM major may also assist the Color\\nguards when uncasing more than two Colors.\\nRECEIVING OR DISMISSING THE COLORS BY COLOR COMPANY\\n15-23. The designated Color company receives and dismisses the Colors as follows:\\n\\uf06c The Color company should receive the Colors before it forms with the battalion.\\n\\uf06c The Color company forms at Attention with the commander facing to the front as the Colors near\\nthe Color company.\\n\\uf06c The Color guard, guided by the senior sergeant, approaches from the front and halts 10 steps from\\nthe company commander.\\n\\uf06c The company commander then faces about and commands Present, ARMS, faces the Colors, and\\nSalutes. They terminate their Salute, faces about, and commands Order, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c The specialists or privates of the Color guard execute Present Arms and return to Right Shoulder\\nArms on the commands of the company commander (Present Arms and Order Arms).\\n15-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Colors\\n\\uf06c The senior sergeant then marches the Color guard to its position within the company formation. If\\nthe company is in column formation, the Color guard forms at the rear of the company. When the\\ncompany is in line or mass formation, the Color guard forms at the left of the company. The Color\\ncompany may join the battalion before the battalion forms at the ceremony site or join with the\\nbattalion at the ceremony site. When the Color company joins the battalion, the senior Color\\nsergeant marches the Color guard to its appropriate post in the battalion formation.\\n\\uf06c The Color guard is dismissed at the conclusion of the ceremony. This can occur in the vicinity of\\nthe ceremony site, in the Color company area, or at the battalion headquarters. At the designated\\narea, the senior sergeant marches and halts the Color guard 10 steps in front of and facing the\\ncommander of the Color company. The actions for dismissing the Colors are the same as receiving\\nthe Colors. After being dismissed, the Color guard marches to the office, headquarters, or tent of\\nthe commanding officer.\\n\\uf06c The Colors are received and dismissed from organizations smaller than a company, such as a\\nfuneral escort, in a similar manner.\\n\\uf06c Casing and uncasing the Colors may be scheduled in conjunction with receiving and dismissing\\nthe Colors.\\nPOSTING AND RETIRING THE COLORS\\n15-24. Formal assemblies conducted indoors begin with the presentation of the Colors, referred to as\\nposting the Colors, and end with the retirement of the Colors. The following instructions outline the\\nprocedures for posting and retiring the Colors, with a head table and without head table. Since indoor areas\\nvary in size, configuration, and intended purpose, these instructions do not apply to all situations. Therefore,\\npersons planning an indoor ceremony can modify these instructions based on their specific floor plan. Color\\nbearers must conduct a reconnaissance of the ceremony location taking note of the dimensions of the room.\\nLow ceilings will present significant challenges when trying to raise and lower Colors.\\nPOSTING THE COLORS\\n15-25. The Color guard forms outside the entrance to the dining area, auditorium, or meeting hall. The\\naudience is directed to stand until the Colors are posted. If the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d (or\\nother appropriate music) and the invocation are scheduled, the audience will remain standing until they are\\ncompleted:\\n\\uf06c When the arrangements include a head table, the Color guard enters in a line formation, preferably,\\nor forms in a line immediately inside the room and moves to a position centered on and facing the\\nhead table:\\n\\uf0a7 When the Colors arrive at the predesignated position, the Color sergeant commands Colors,\\nHALT, and Present, ARMS; and reports \u201cThe Colors are present.\u201d The host acknowledges\\nthe report and directs POST THE COLORS. The area should be arranged to allow adequate\\nspace for the Color guard to move between the head table and the flag stand.\\n\\uf0a7 The Color sergeant then commands Order, ARMS; Right, FACE; and Forward, MARCH.\\nOn the command of execution MARCH, the Color guard marches to the rear of the head table\\n(see figure 15-1 on page 15-7).\\n\\uf0a7 Once the Color guard is centered on the flag stand, they Mark Time and the Color sergeant\\ncommands Colors, HALT and Right, FACE. The Color guard should approach the flag\\nstands from the right to position the national Color bearer in front of the flag holder on the\\nright, facing the audience.\\n\\uf0a7 The Color bearers, without command, place the Colors in the stand.\\n\\uf0a7 When the Colors are in the stand, the Color sergeant commands Present, ARMS and Order,\\nARMS. The guards return to Right Shoulder Arms; the Color sergeant commands Left, FACE\\nand Forward, MARCH; and the Color guard exits the area.\\n\\uf06c When a head table is not used, the Color guard enters and moves to a predesignated position\\ncentered on and facing the audience. This may require the Color guard to move in a column and\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 15-5Chapter 15\\nuse Facing movements. The movement must be planned so that the national Color is always on\\nthe right when in line and is leading when in column.\\n\\uf06c When the Colors arrive at the predesignated position, the Color sergeant commands Colors,\\nHALT; Left (Right), FACE; and Present, ARMS. Any scheduled music or the Pledge of\\nAllegiance then occurs. The Color sergeant then commands Order, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c The Color sergeant commands Right (Left), FACE and Forward, MARCH. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the Color guard marches to the flag stand where the actions of the Color\\nguard are the same as previously described.\\nRETIRING THE COLORS\\n15-26. The audience is directed to stand for the retiring of the Colors:\\n\\uf06c When a head table is used, the Color sergeant moves the Color guard to the head table:\\n\\uf0a7 The Color sergeant commands Color guard, HALT; Present, ARMS, and reports to the host,\\n\u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, request permission to retire the Colors.\u201d The host acknowledges the report\\nand directs RETIRE THE COLORS.\\n\\uf0a7 The Color sergeant commands Order, ARMS; Right, FACE; Forward, MARCH; and\\nmoves the Color guard until they are centered on the flag stand where they Mark Time.\\n\\uf0a7 The Color sergeant commands Color guard, HALT; Right, FACE; Present, ARMS; and\\nOrder, ARMS. Upon completion of Order Arms the Color bearers, without command, retrieve\\nthe Colors and assume the Carry Position.\\n\\uf0a7 The Color sergeant commands FACE and Forward, MARCH. The Color guard exits the\\narea.\\n\\uf06c When the head table is not used, the Color guard moves directly to the flag stands where the Colors\\nare retrieved. The Color guard exits as previously described.\\nNote. These procedures will vary when the CSM oversees the Colors during a formal dining-in.\\n15-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Colors\\nFigure 15-1.

At the Order, rest the ferrule of the staff on the marching surface touching the outside of the right\\nfootgear opposite the ball of the right foot. Hold the staff in the right hand with the back of the hand facing\\noutward and the fingers wrapped around the staff. Rest the staff against the hollow of the shoulder (see\\nfigure 15-6).\\nFigure 15-6. Position of the Colors at the Order\\nPOSITION OF THE COLORS AT THE CARRY\\n15-34. At the Carry, rest the ferrule of the staff in the socket of the sling. The socket is below the waist and\\nadjusted to ensure that the finials of all Colors are of equal height (see figure 15-7). Grasp the staff with the\\nright hand (even with the mouth) and incline it slightly to the front with the left hand securing the ferrule in\\nthe socket. The left hand may be positioned immediately below the right hand to more firmly secure the\\nColors on windy days.\\n15-14 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Colors\\nFigure 15-7.

In the 19th century,\\nbranches of service were lined up from right to left: Infantry, field artillery, and\\nCavalry, respectively. Field artillery lined up their guns but did not fire them. When\\nhonors began to be fired in ceremonies, the guns were moved out of the formation to\\navoid injury to other elements of the formation.\\nSECTION I \u2013 PREPARATION\\n16-1. The salute battery should arrive at the ceremonial site early enough to position its pieces before the\\narrival of units on the ready line:\\n\\uf06c The pieces are positioned downwind from the ceremony site with the muzzles pointing away from\\nthe reviewing stand. When possible, the opened trails are two steps to the rear of the final line and\\nthe number six piece is positioned twelve steps from the left flank unit. Other pieces are positioned\\nabout four steps apart (measure from inside wheels) and on line with number six.\\n\\uf06c Once the pieces are in position, the battery is formed to the left of the number one piece and in\\nfront of the line so that the number six and three sections are on the final line (see figure 16-1).\\nFigure 16-1. Position of salute battery and personnel before the review\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 16-1Chapter 16\\nSECTION II \u2013 SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS\\n16-2. The sequence of events and individual actions necessary to conduct a salute battery are described\\nherein. The COT should verify that the salute battery and band are prepared to render honors.\\nFORMATION OF TROOPS\\n16-3. On hearing the band sound Attention, the battery commander Faces About, commands Battery,\\nATTENTION, and again faces about:\\n\\uf06c On completion of the adjutant\u2019s call, the battery commander Faces About and commands Right,\\nFACE. They then command Section, POST.\\n\\uf06c The section chiefs in reverse sequence (for example, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) command Forward, MARCH\\nor Column Half Right, MARCH. The sections march forward along the final line and halt when\\ncentered on the piece.\\n\\uf06c The battery commander faces to the left and commands (themselves and their staff) Column Half\\nRight, MARCH. They march forward (inclining as necessary) so that when halted the battery\\ncommander is six steps from and centered on the firing battery. The section chief and the counter\\nshould be centered and three steps to the rear of the commander. The executive officer is on line\\nwith the guidon bearer.\\n\\uf06c When the battery commander has halted their staff, they face to the right and command Left,\\nFACE. Then they command Dress right, DRESS; Ready, FRONT; and Parade, REST (for large\\nreviews, the command AT EASE may be substituted for Parade, REST). The commander then\\nfaces about and executes Parade Rest.\\nPRESENTATION OF HONORS\\n16-4. When the COT has directed Order Arms (adjutant has taken their post), the battery commander faces\\nabout and commands Order, ARMS. They then direct FIRE THE SALUTE and faces about:\\n\\uf06c The battery commander quietly commands (themselves and their guidon bearer) Present, ARMS\\nand Order, ARMS, as appropriate.\\n\\uf06c The executive officer, counter, and chief of the firing battery face about. The executive officer\\ncommands Cannoneers, POST. The cannoneers immediately move to their firing positions.\\n\\uf06c The executive officer commands With blank ammunition (pause), LOAD. They then command\\nSTAND BY, NUMBER ONE. As each piece is ready to fire, the section chief raises their arm\\n(nearest the executive officer) and looks at the executive officer.\\n\\uf06c When all section chiefs have indicated they are ready (arm raised), the executive officer raises\\ntheir right arm and looks at the COT. The COT takes the raised arm as the signal that the battery\\nis ready to fire. They then face about and command (themselves and their staff) Present, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c As the commander\u2019s hand touches their headgear, the executive officer signals the first piece to\\nfire. The executive officer drops their arm to a horizontal position and then raises it back to a\\nvertical position for each round. Rounds are fired at 3-second intervals for normal honors and\\n5-second intervals for funerals (see AR 600-25).\\n\\uf06c During the Salute, as the second to last round is fired, the counter faces about and announces\\nELEVEN. As the next to last round is fired, the chief of the firing battery Faces About and\\nannounces TWELVE. This is the signal for the executive officer to fire one more round.\\n\\uf06c During the firing, each section immediately reloads after each round is fired and is prepared to fire\\nin case of a misfire. When the last round has been fired, the executive officer signals CEASE\\nFIRE and then signals UNLOAD.\\n\\uf06c When all pieces are unloaded and the cannoneers are at Attention, the executive officer commands\\nto the rear of the piece, FALL IN (cannoneers automatically fall in at Dress Right); they then\\ncommand Ready, FRONT and Parade, REST. When all sections are back in position on the final\\nline, the executive officer faces about.\\n16-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Salute Battery\\nINSPECTION\\n16-5. As the reviewing party approaches piece number six, the battery commander faces about and\\ncommands Battery, ATTENTION. They then face to the front and (over their right shoulder) command\\nEyes, RIGHT:\\n\\uf06c The battery commander and executive officer execute Eyes Right and Salute. The guidon bearer\\nexecutes Eyes Right and Present Guidon. All others execute Eyes Right and follow the reviewing\\nofficer, turning the head until facing to the front.\\n\\uf06c When the reviewing party has passed the last piece, the battery commander commands Order,\\nARMS for themselves, the executive officer, and the guidon bearer. They then face about. When\\nthe reviewing party has cleared the right rear of their unit, they then command Parade, REST,\\nfaces about, and assumes Parade Rest.\\nHONORS TO THE NATION AND REMARKS\\n16-6. The battery executes appropriate movements on command or directives by the COT. The COT always\\nverifies the battery is prepared for each movement.\\nMARCH IN REVIEW\\n16-7. On the command or directive to PASS IN REVIEW, the battery commander faces about and\\ncommands Parade, REST. They then face about and assume Parade Rest.\\nCONCLUSION\\n16-8. When the band begins the eight-bar drum beat (before \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along\u201d), the battery\\ncommander faces about and commands Battery, ATTENTION. They then face about. When the band has\\nfinished playing the music, the battery commander faces about and commands REST.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 16-3This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 17\\nCivilian Participation in Military Ceremonies\\nThis chapter serves as a guide for commanders in planning and conducting military\\nceremonies with civilian participation.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n17-1. Since its inception at the beginning of the American Revolution, the U.S. Army has always seen the\\nimportance of civilian control of the military and participation of civilians in military activities. As a result,\\nmilitary ceremonies are frequently held to honor civilians.\\nSECTION II \u2013 TYPES OF CEREMONIES\\n17-2. Civilians may participate in three general categories of military ceremonies:\\n\\uf06c Presenting awards.\\n\\uf06c Receiving awards.\\n\\uf06c Being honored.\\nCIVILIANS PRESENTING AWARDS\\n17-3. This category includes occasions when an award is made to another civilian and occasions when\\nawards are presented to military personnel by a civilian. These ceremonies are conducted as previously\\noutlined with the following exceptions:\\n\\uf06c The host or reviewing officer is accompanied to the reviewing stand by the civilian. The reviewing\\nofficer may relinquish the place of honor to the civilian.\\n\\uf06c The reviewing officer accompanies the civilian throughout the sequence of events.\\n\\uf06c Because of lack of familiarity with military ceremonies, it may be necessary to brief the civilian\\nbefore and during the conduct of the ceremony.\\nCIVILIANS RECEIVING AWARDS\\n17-4. Conduct of these ceremonies should be guided by paragraph 10-25 with the following exceptions:\\n\\uf06c Civilians should be initially positioned to the left of the reviewing stand and not marched forward\\nwith the military personnel, if any, to receive awards.\\n\\uf06c When the Colors are brought forward, civilians move to a position five steps in front of and\\ncentered on the Colors. When military and civilians receive an award at the same time, they are\\naligned from right to left with the highest award on the right.\\n\\uf06c When the awardees are posted, they remain in the same order. If there are no military awardees,\\nthe civilians move to the left of the reviewing stand.\\n\\uf06c When this ceremony is conducted for presenting posthumous awards, other types of awards are\\nnot incorporated. A carefully selected escort officer should accompany relatives of persons\\nreceiving posthumous awards.\\nNote. If there is only one awardee, they may be the reviewing official.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 17-1Chapter 17\\nREVIEWS IN HONOR OF CIVILIANS\\n17-5. Government employees, private citizens; and local, state, national, or foreign officials may be honored\\nby a review. (See AR 600-25 for special honors due for certain officials.) Other civilians may be honored, as\\nnoted in paragraphs 17-3 and 17-4, by participating in the place of or with the reviewing officer.\\n17-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Appendix A\\nSaluting\\nThe origin of the Hand Salute is uncertain. Some historians believe it began in late\\nRoman times when assassinations were common. A citizen who wanted to see a public\\nofficial had to approach with their right hand raised to show that they did not hold a\\nweapon. Knights in armor raised visors with the right hand when meeting a comrade.\\nThis practice gradually became a way of showing respect and, in early American\\nhistory, sometimes involved removing the hat. By 1820, the motion was modified to\\ntouching the hat, and since then it has become the Hand Salute used today.\\nWHEN TO SALUTE\\nA-1. Army personnel in uniform are required to salute when they meet and recognize persons entitled (by\\ngrade) to a salute except when it is inappropriate or impractical (in public conveyances such as planes and\\nbuses, in public places such as inside theaters, or when driving a vehicle):\\n\\uf06c Salutes are also rendered\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 When the U.S. national anthem, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d \u201cHail to the Chief,\u201d or foreign national\\nanthems are played.\\n\\uf0a7 To uncased national Color outdoors.\\n\\uf0a7 On ceremonial occasions as prescribed in Part Two, Ceremonies.\\n\\uf0a7 At reveille and retreat ceremonies, during the raising or lowering of the flag.\\n\\uf0a7 During the sounding of honors.\\n\\uf0a7 When the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag is being recited outdoors.\\n\\uf0a7 When turning over control of formations.\\n\\uf0a7 When rendering reports.\\n\\uf0a7 To officers of friendly foreign countries.\\n\\uf06c Salutes are not required when\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Indoors, except when reporting to an officer or when on duty as a guard.\\n\\uf0a7 Addressing a prisoner.\\n\\uf0a7 Saluting is obviously inappropriate. In these cases, only greetings are exchanged. (Example:\\nA person carrying articles with both hands, or otherwise occupied so that saluting is\\nimpracticable, is not required to salute a senior person or return the salute to a subordinate.)\\n\\uf0a7 Either the senior or the subordinate is wearing civilian clothes.\\n\\uf06c In any case not covered by specific instructions, the salute is rendered.\\nREPORTING INDOORS\\nA-2. When reporting to an officer in their office, the Soldier removes their headgear, knocks, and enters\\nwhen told to do so. They approach within two steps of the officer\u2019s desk, Halts, Salutes, and Reports, \u201cSir\\n(Ma\u2019am), Private Smit reports.\u201d The salute is held until the report is completed and the salute has been\\nreturned by the officer. When the business is completed, the Soldier salutes, holds the salute until it has been\\nreturned, executes the appropriate facing movement, and departs. When reporting indoors under arms, the\\nprocedure is the same except that the headgear is not removed and the Soldier renders the salute prescribed\\nfor the weapon with which they are armed.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 A-1Appendix A\\nNotes. 1. The expression \u201cunder arms\u201d means carrying a weapon in your hands, by a sling, or in a\\nholster.\\n2.When reporting to a NCO, the procedures are the same, except no salutes are exchanged.\\nREPORTING OUTDOORS\\nA-3. When reporting outdoors, the Soldier moves rapidly toward the officer, and halts approximately three\\nsteps from the officer, Salutes, and Reports (as when indoors). When the Soldier is dismissed by the officer,\\nsalutes are again exchanged. If under arms, the Soldier carries the weapon in the manner prescribed for\\nsaluting.\\nSALUTING PERSONS IN VEHICLES\\nA-4. The practice of saluting officers in official vehicles (recognized individually by grade or identifying\\nvehicle plates and or flags) is considered an appropriate courtesy. Salutes are not required to be rendered by\\nor to personnel who are driving or riding in privately owned vehicles except by gate guards, who render\\nsalutes to recognized officers in all vehicles unless their duties make the salute impractical. When military\\npersonnel are drivers of a moving vehicle, they do not initiate a salute (see AR 600-25).\\nOTHER SALUTES\\nA-5. Other instances when saluting may or may not be required\u2014when in formation, not in formation,\\noutdoors, and indoors. Each have different requirements in regards to salutes and are discussed herein.\\nIN FORMATION\\nA-6. Individuals in formation do not salute or return salutes except at the command Present, ARMS. The\\nindividual in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the entire formation. Commanders of organizations\\nor detachments that are not a part of a larger formation salute officers of higher grade by bringing the\\norganization or detachment to attention before saluting. When in the field under battle or simulated battle\\nconditions, the organization or detachment is not brought to attention. An individual in formation at ease or\\nat rest comes to attention when addressed by an officer.\\nNOT IN FORMATION\\nA-7. On the approach of an officer, a group of individuals not in formation is called to Attention by the first\\nperson noticing the officer, and all come sharply to Attention and salute. This action is to be taken at\\napproximately six paces away from the officer, or the closest point of approach. Individuals participating in\\ngames, and members of work details, do not salute. The individual in charge of a work detail, if not actively\\nengaged, salutes and acknowledges Salutes for the entire detail. A unit resting alongside a road does not come\\nto Attention upon the approach of an officer; however, if the officer addresses an individual (or group), the\\nindividual (or group) comes to Attention and remains at Attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the\\ntermination of the conversation, at which time the individual (or group) Salutes the officer.\\nOUTDOORS\\nA-8. Whenever and wherever the U.S. national anthem, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d \u201cReveille,\u201d or \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d\\nis played, at the first note, all dismounted personnel in uniform and not in formation face the flag (or the\\nmusic, if the flag is not in view), stand at Attention, and render the prescribed Salute. The position of Salute\\nis held until the last note of the music is sounded. Military personnel not in uniform will stand at Attention\\n(remove headdress, if any, with the right hand), and place the right hand over the heart. Vehicles in motion\\nare brought to a Halt. Persons riding in a passenger car or on a motorcycle dismount and salute. Occupants\\nof other types of military vehicles and buses remain in the vehicle and sit at attention; the individual in charge\\nA-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Saluting\\nof each vehicle dismounts and renders the Hand Salute. Tank and armored car commanders Salute from the\\nvehicle.\\nINDOORS\\nA-9. When the national anthem is played indoors, officers and enlisted personnel stand at Attention and face\\nthe music, or the flag if one is present. There is no saluting indoors except when reporting to a commander\\nand when on duty as a guard as previously mentioned at the beginning of this appendix.\\nNote. Narrators or printed programs can help inform spectators of appropriate responses.\\nSALUTING COLORS\\nA-10. National and organizational flags, which are mounted on flagstaffs equipped with finials, are called\\nColors. Military personnel passing an uncased national Color salute at six steps distance and hold the Salute\\nuntil they have passed six steps beyond it. Similarly, when the uncased Color passes by, they Salute when it\\nis six steps away and hold the Salute until it has passed six steps beyond them.\\nNote. Small flags carried by individuals, such as those carried by civilian spectators at a parade,\\nare not saluted. It is improper to salute with any object in the right hand or with a cigarette, cigar,\\nor pipe in the mouth.\\nUNCOVERING\\nA-11. Officers and enlisted Soldiers under arms uncover only when\u2014\\n\\uf06c Seated as a member of (or in attendance on) a court or board.\\n\\uf06c Entering places of divine worship.\\n\\uf06c In attendance at an official reception.\\nA-12. Personnel remove their headdress indoors. When outdoors, military headdress is never removed, or\\nraised as a form of salutation. When appropriate, civilians may be saluted in lieu of removing the headdress.\\nSALUTING UPON BOARDING NAVAL SHIPS\\nA-13. When Army personnel board U.S. Navy ships, either as an individual or as a unit leader, they salute\\naccording to naval procedures:\\n\\uf06c When boarding a naval ship, upon reaching the top of the gangway, face and salute the national\\nensign. After completing this salute, salute the officer of the deck who will be standing on the\\nquarter deck at the head of the gangway. When saluting the officer of the deck, request permission\\nto board, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, request permission to come aboard.\u201d The officer of the deck will return\\nthe salute.\\n\\uf06c When leaving the ship, render the same salutes in reverse order, and request permission to leave,\\n\u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, request permission to go ashore.\u201d\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 A-3This page intentionally left blank.Appendix B\\nManual of Arms\u2014M16-Series Rifle\\nThe manual of arms movements for the M16-series rifle (see figure B-1) are nearly the\\nsame as those for the M4-series carbine.

The scabbard is rotated so that its tip is forward, and the saber (sword) bearer comes to\\nAttention (see figure E-7, item 3).\\nFigure E-7. Return Saber (Sword)\\nMARCHING MANUAL OF ARMS\\nE-14. While marching, the saber (sword) is carried with the inner blade edge riding in a vertical position\\nalong the forward tip of the right shoulder (see figure E-8). The saber (sword) remains parallel with the right\\narm as the Soldier marches.\\nE-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Manual of Arms\u2014Saber and Sword\\nFigure E-8. Marching position\\nEYES RIGHT WHILE MARCHING\\nE-15. The command Ready, Eyes, RIGHT is executed while marching at Carry Saber (Sword). The\\ncommand Ready is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface (no action is taken). The second time\\nthe right foot strikes the marching surface, the command Eyes is given and the saber (sword) is brought to\\nthe position (count one position) of Present Arms. No action is taken the third time the right foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. The fourth time the right foot strikes the marching surface, the command RIGHT is given.\\nAs the foot strikes the marching surface, the head is turned sharply to the right at a 45-degree angle, and the\\nsaber (sword) is brought downward (see figure E-9 on page E-10).\\nNote.

While marching at Present Saber (Sword), the right arm is swung naturally (9 inches to the front and\\n6 inches to the rear) in a vertical plane, flexing the wrist to keep the tip of the blade level (about 6 inches)\\nabove the marching surface. This requires extending the wrist on the forward movement and elevating the\\nwrist on the rearward movement.\\nE-17. The command Ready, FRONT is executed as follows: The command Ready is given as the right foot\\nstrikes the marching surface (no action is taken). The second time the right foot strikes the marching surface,\\na second command Ready is given (again, no action is taken). The saber (sword) is returned to the Order\\nposition while maintaining the arm swing as the right foot strikes the marching surface the third time.

It is present at all unit\\nformations unless otherwise directed by the commander.\\nWhen armed with a rifle, the guidon bearer slings the weapon behind their back with\\nthe sling diagonally across their chest and the muzzle end up and to the right.\\nBASIC GUIDON POSITIONS\\nF-1. When the unit is formed, the guidon bearer is one step in front of and two 15-inch left steps to the right\\nof and facing the person forming the unit (the person forming the unit is facing the unit). If the first sergeant\\nforms the unit, the guidon bearer steps forward three steps on the command POST.\\nF-2. To face with the guidon, raise the ferrule 1 inch off the marching surface by bending the right elbow\\nslightly. After executing the movement, automatically lower the ferrule to the Order position. Keep the staff\\nvertical throughout the movement.\\nF-3. Execute facing movements, marching movements, Present Arms (Present Guidon), and Rest\\nmovements with the unit. During manual of arms movements, remain at Order Guidon except for Present\\nArms (see figure F-1 on page F-2).\\nF-4. When in a line formation and the company is faced to the right for a marching movement, face to the\\nright in marching, assume the Double-Time position (see figure F-7 on page F-8) and double-time from that\\nposition to a position five steps forward of and centered on the squad leaders of the first platoon. If the\\ncompany commander joins the formation at the head of the column (six steps in front of and centered on the\\nsquad leaders), execute two left steps.\\nF-5. If a platoon is authorized a guidon or phase banner (in training units for example), the bearer\u2019s post is\\none step in front of and two 15-inch steps to the right of and facing the person forming the platoon. When\\nthe formation is faced to the right for a marching movement, the bearer executes in the same manner as\\nexplained above, except that their post is three steps in front of and centered on the squad leaders. If the\\nplatoon leader is present and at their post, the bearer\u2019s post is one step to the rear and two 15-inch steps to\\nthe left of the platoon leader.\\nF-6. When the guidon bearer is marching at their post in a column formation during a Column Left (Right),\\nthey execute a Column Half Left (Right) on the command of execution and incline as necessary to maintain\\ntheir post. The guidon bearer inclines as necessary to maintain their post.\\nNote.

It\\nalso shows the sequence of events for a change of command and change of\\nresponsibility ceremonies.\\nG-1. Ceremonies honor lineage and history, thereby requiring the utmost in respect and courtesy. Military\\nceremonies can honor high-ranking commanders, officials, or dignitaries; or permit them to observe the state\\nof training of an organization. Military ceremonies can also be used to present decorations and awards, honor\\nor recognize unit or individual achievements, commemorate events, mark changes of command and\\nresponsibility, and induct newly promoted NCOs into the ranks. Presentation of awards recognizes\\ndistinguished accomplishment by the Service member. AR 600-8-22 states that awards will be presented with\\nan appropriate air of formality and with fitting ceremony.\\nG-2. There are several different types of ceremonies that units will occasionally conduct. Unit CSMs and\\ntheir staff will develop their own sequence of events for the following types of ceremonies:\\n\\uf06c Change of command.\\n\\uf06c Change of responsibility.\\n\\uf06c NCO induction.\\n\\uf06c Assumption of responsibility.\\n\\uf06c Relinquishment of responsibility.\\n\\uf06c Award.\\n\\uf06c Deployment and redeployment.\\n\\uf06c Hail and farewell.\\n\\uf06c Army school graduation (special units).\\n\\uf06c Award of Expert Infantry Badge or Expert Field Medical Badge.\\n\\uf06c Wreath laying.\\n\\uf06c Special events.\\n\\uf06c Spurs awarding (Cavalry specific).\\nG-3. Most ceremonies will include some of the mandatory events listed in the reviews chapter and end with\\nthe playing of the Army song. A unit CSM or their designated representative develops their ceremony specific\\nSOP and ensure the preparedness of the unit conducting the ceremony. If the ceremony is conducted at the\\ncompany or troop level, then the responsibilities for the sequence of events could be delegated to the company\\nfirst sergeant and command team. Hail and farewells do not require the playing of the national anthem or\\nplaying of the Army song.

When the adjutant announces\\n\u201cAttention to Orders\u201d everyone present at the ceremony silence all conversations and focus on the\\npresentation of the award. If the commander requires military members present at the ceremony to be at the\\nposition of Attention, then execution command ATTENTION is given prior to the presentation of the award.\\nPlease see the example below.\\nExample:\\nFormal setting: During a squadron award ceremony the unit is in a squadron formation.\\nThe squadron commander calls all awardees to post. The awardees march to a\\ndesignated spot in front of the formation and are prepared to receive their awards. The\\nsquadron commander announces Squadron, ATTENTION. They then direct the\\nadjutant to publish the orders. The adjutant reads off all Soldier\u2019s awards to the entire\\nformation while the squadron commander and CSM present the awards to the\\nawardees.\\nInformal setting: During a troop hail and farewell ceremony at a local establishment or\\nbanquet hall, the troop commander presents a few permanent change of station\\nawards to deserving Soldiers. The troop commander would ask the awardees to move\\nto the front of the crowd to receive their award. The troop commander, at their\\ndiscretion, would then direct their executive officer or troop representative to publish\\nthe orders. The adjutant would announce \u201cAttention to Orders.\u201d All personnel in\\nattendance of the ceremony would silence all conversations and direct all their\\nattention to the presentation of the award.\\nG-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Appendix H\\nMounted Drill\\nThis appendix contains the procedures for the orderly formation and movement of\\nvehicles during drill and ceremonies for motorized and mechanized units. When\\nnecessary, the procedures may be modified to conform to local conditions.\\nGENERAL\\nH-1. Motorized and mechanized units, when dismounted, conduct drill and ceremonies in the same manner\\nas prescribed for Infantry units. The COT has the same responsibilities as well.\\nH-2. When mounted in vehicles, visible troops sit at Attention. Those armed with a rifle place the butt of\\nthe weapon alongside the right foot in the same manner as Order Arms, with the weapon vertical and parallel\\nto the calf of the leg. Grasp the weapon with the right hand so that the right forearm is horizontal. Visible\\ntroops not armed with a rifle, fold their arms (right over the left) and raise the elbows so that the upper arms\\nare horizontal.\\nH-3. When marching units and motorized and/or mechanized units take part in the same ceremony, the units\\nform dismounted (in a formation corresponding to the marching units) with their vehicles to the rear. On the\\ndirective PASS IN REVIEW, the commander faces about and directs at your vehicles, FALL IN or\\nMOUNT (LOAD) YOUR VEHICLES. Subordinate commanders and leaders, in sequence from right to\\nleft, command At your vehicles, FALL IN (MOUNT YOUR VEHICLES) and all vehicle members\\ndouble-time to their vehicle. On the signal to mount, they mount their vehicle. Drivers observe their\\ncommander or leader for the signal to start engines.\\nFORMATIONS\\nH-4. The formations for motorized and mechanized units are basically the same as for Infantry units. The\\ninterval between vehicles is about five steps. The distance is about 10 steps between vehicles one behind the\\nother. Mass formations may be used for ceremonies or instruction by companies or larger units:\\n\\uf06c Column. In this formation, the vehicles are placed one behind the other, and the right edges of the\\nvehicles are aligned.\\n\\uf06c Line. In this formation, vehicles are abreast, and the front edges of the vehicles are aligned.\\n\\uf06c Mass. A unit formed with two or more columns abreast constitutes a mass. Masses may be grouped\\nas follows:\\n\\uf0a7 Line of masses. Masses abreast with 10-step intervals (see figure H-1 on page H-2).\\n\\uf0a7 Column of masses. Masses placed one behind another with 10-step intervals between\\ncompanies (see figure H-2 on page H-3).\\n\\uf0a7 Line of battalions in line of masses. Battalions in line of masses abreast with 20-step intervals\\nbetween battalions.\\n\\uf0a7 Line of battalions in column of masses. Battalions in column of masses abreast with 20-step\\nintervals between battalions.\\n\\uf0a7 Column of battalions in line of masses. Battalions in line of masses, placed one behind\\nanother, with 20-step intervals between battalions.\\n\\uf0a7 Column of battalions in columns of masses. Battalions in column of masses, placed one\\nbehind another, with 20-step intervals between battalions.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 H-1Appendix H\\nFigure H-1.

Personnel form at the vehicles before mounting using the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To form at the vehicles from any formation, the command is At your vehicles, FALL IN. At the\\ncommand FALL IN, the Soldiers move (double-time) to their assigned vehicles and form as\\nshown in figure H-3 on page H-4. When there are more than five Soldiers, they form two or three\\nranks with normal distance. When there are more than 15 Soldiers, the number of Soldiers per\\nrank may be increased. (Artillery sections form as prescribed in service-of-the-piece manuals.)\\n\\uf06c To load, the command is Load, VEHICLES. On the command of execution VEHICLES, each\\nSoldier double-times and forms at their vehicle (as previously described).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 H-3Appendix H\\nFigure H-3. Formation at the vehicle\\nMOVEMENT OF VEHICLES\\nH-6. Execute the following actions to move vehicles:\\n\\uf06c To move forward, the commander gives the warning signal FORWARD, and their vehicle moves\\nout. The other vehicles move forward at the designated distance. They are aligned on the base\\nvehicle (right).\\n\\uf06c To halt, the commander signals HALT. The driver then slows down and halts the commander\u2019s\\nvehicle. The other vehicles close to the prescribed distance and halt.\\n\\uf06c To change the direction of travel of mass formation, the commander gives the appropriate signal.\\nOn the commander\u2019s signal, the base vehicle turns 90 degrees and slows. Other vehicles turn about\\n45 degrees and continue traveling in an arc at normal speed until on line with the base vehicle. As\\nthe vehicles form on line, the base vehicle accelerates as necessary to maintain correct distance on\\nthe commander.\\nH-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Mounted Drill\\n\\uf06c To change a line formation to a column formation, the commander signals for a column. The base\\nvehicle, and those directly behind it, move forward. Other vehicles move at a 45-degree angle until\\nin line with the lead vehicle and then execute a 45-degree turn.\\n\\uf06c To change a column formation to a line formation, the commander signals a line formation. The\\nbase (right flank vehicle) stops and all other vehicles turn at a 45-degree angle, turn again at a\\n45-degree angle when the prescribed interval is obtained, and then halt when on line with the base\\nvehicle.\\nMOUNTED REVIEWS\\nH-7. Motorized and mechanized units conduct ceremonies as close as possible to the procedures prescribed\\nfor other units. They may participate (exactly as prescribed for marching units) as a dismounted unit, and on\\nthe directive PASS IN REVIEW, mount their vehicles and pass in review mounted. When desired, motorized\\nand mechanized units may position their vehicles in a prescribed formation and remain mounted throughout\\nthe ceremony.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 H-5This page intentionally left blank.Appendix I\\nFlags and Colors\\nNormally, a flag detail consists of one NCOIC, two halyard pullers, and two to eight\\nflag handlers. The purpose of the flag handlers is to ensure correct folding (unfolding)\\nof the flag and to ensure that the flag does not touch the ground. As a guide, two flag\\nhandlers are needed when raising or lowering the storm (small) flag, six handlers for\\nthe post (medium) flag, and eight handlers for the garrison (large) flag.\\nThe members of the flag detail are equipped according to local SOP and/or letter of\\ninstructions.\\nThe NCOIC inconspicuously gives the necessary commands or directives to ensure\\nproper performance by the flag detail. On windy days, the NCOIC may assist the flag\\nhandlers to secure or fold the flag. In most other situations, it is inappropriate for the\\nNCOIC to touch the flag when it is being folded or unfolded.\\nRAISING, LOWERING, AND FOLDING THE FLAG\\nI-1. Installation commanders set the time to play reveille and raise their installations flags. The flag is raised\\nat the first note of reveille. The flag is hoisted all the way to the top of the flagpole unless there are\\ncircumstances that require the U.S. flag to be flown at half mass, and those circumstances could be found in\\nAR 600-25. If the flag is flown at half-staff the flag is first hoisted all the way to the top of the pole, and then\\nbrought back down to half mass where it will remain until it is lowered.\\nI-2. Retreat is played at the time established by the installation commander, and the flag detail will lower\\nthe flag concurrent with the playing of the national anthem, or \u201cTo the Color,\u201d and after retreat. A cannon\\nsalute will go off (if available) on the final note of retreat. The flag will be lowered to ensure completion of\\nthe last note of the music. If the flag is being flown at half mast, it will be raised all the way to the top of the\\nflagpole before being lowered. The flag will be folded as discussed later in this appendix.\\nRAISING THE FLAG (REVEILLE)\\nI-3. Execute the following actions when raising the flag:\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC forms the detail in a column of twos at Double Interval between files (see figure I-1\\non page I-2). The NCOIC secures the flag from its storage area and positions themselves between\\nthe files and on line with the last two Soldiers. The NCOIC then marches the detail to the flagpole.\\n\\uf06c The detail is halted in a column, facing the flagpole on the downwind side or as appropriate. They\\nare halted so that the flagpole is centered between the halyard pullers. The NCOIC commands\\nPOST. On this command, the halyard pullers immediately move to the flagpole and ensure that\\nthe halyards are free of the pole. The flag handlers face to the center. The NCOIC then directs\\nUNFOLD THE FLAG. On this directive, the two flag handlers nearest the NCOIC begin to\\n(carefully) unfold the flag lengthwise, passing the freed end to the other handlers. When the two\\nhandlers nearest the flagpole have firmly secured the flag, the other handlers move away from the\\nflagpole (as necessary) until the flag is fully extended. The flag is not unfolded widthwise. The\\nflag handlers hold the flag waist high with their forearms horizontal to the ground.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 I-1Appendix I\\nFigure I-1. Flag detail\\n\\uf06c At the appropriate time, the NCOIC directs ATTACH THE FLAG. On this directive, all flag\\nhandlers take one side step toward the flagpole. The two handlers nearest the flagpole immediately\\nattach the top of the flag to the halyard. The halyard pullers raise the flag until the bottom of the\\nflag can be attached.\\nNote. When raising the larger flags, the NCOIC may command Ready, STEP while the halyard\\npullers raise the halyard until the lower portion of the flag is attached.\\n\\uf06c At the first note of the music, the reveille gun is fired and the halyard pullers rapidly raise the flag.\\nThe NCOIC salutes. As the flag is raised from the handlers\u2019 hands, they face the flagpole and\\nSalute. (Reveille is about 20 seconds in duration.) At the last note of the music, the NCOIC\\ncommands Order, ARMS for themselves and the flag handlers while the pullers secure the\\nhalyards. The NCOIC then positions themselves between the halyard pullers, executes an About\\nFace, and commands Ready, FACE. The detail will face in the appropriate direction to depart the\\nflagpole. They then march the detail from the site.\\nLOWERING THE FLAG (RETREAT)\\nI-4. Execute the following actions when lowering the flag:\\n\\uf06c When lowering the flag. The detail is marched and positioned at the flagpole in the same manner\\nas when raising the flag. On the command POST, the halyard pullers free the halyards, untangle\\nthem, ensure that they are free from the pole, and then temporarily resecure them; the flag handlers\\ndo not face to the center. The NCOIC then commands Parade, REST.\\n\\uf06c At the cannon shot or at the last note of \u201cRetreat\u201d (if a cannon is not fired), each halyard puller\\nimmediately frees the halyards. The NCOIC commands themselves and the flag handlers to\\nATTENTION and Present, ARMS. At the first note of \u201cTo the Color,\u201d the flag is lowered slowly\\nand with dignity.\\n\\uf06c The call, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d is approximately 40 seconds in duration. As the flag is lowered to within\\nreach, the two flag handlers farthest away from the flag terminate their Salute, move forward\\nrapidly, secure the flag, and move back from the flagpole between the columns:\\n\\uf0a7 As the flag passes each handler, they terminate their Salute and assist in securing the flag.\\nThe flag is held palms down, fingers and thumb extended and joined, forearms horizontal.\\nThe NCOIC terminates their Salute at the last note of the music.\\nI-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\n\\uf0a7 Once the flag is detached, it is then folded. (See figure I-2 on page I-4 for correct folding\\ntechniques.) After securing the halyard, the handlers assist in the folding.\\nNote. When taking steps forward or backward to fold the flag, the members of the detail always\\nstep off with the left foot and always bring the trail foot alongside the lead foot as in the Position\\nof Attention.\\nFOLD THE FLAG\\nI-5. Execute the following actions when folding the flag:\\n\\uf06c To fold the flag the NCOIC commands Ready, STEP. All personnel take the appropriate number\\nof steps backward to ensure that the flag is horizontal, wrinkle free, and centered on the flagpole.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC then commands Ready, STEP. The flag handlers take the appropriate number of steps\\ntoward each other, making the first fold lengthwise. The members on the NCOIC\u2019s right ensure\\nthat their edge of the flag is overlapping the left side by about an inch, which prevents any red\\nfrom showing when the folding is complete. The NCOIC ensures that the flag is straight.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC then commands Ready, TWO. The members of the column on the NCOIC\u2019s left\\nreach down and secure the fold with the fingers pointing upward and the palms facing away.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC then commands Ready, THREE. The members take the appropriate number of steps\\nbackward to ensure that the flag is horizontal, wrinkle free, and centered on the flagpole.\\n\\uf06c Ready, STEP; Ready, TWO; and Ready, THREE are commanded and executed one more time\\nto get the flag completely folded lengthwise.\\n\\uf06c The flag handlers nearest the NCOIC then fold a 4-inch cuff and begin folding the flag, starting\\nwith the corner on the NCOIC\u2019s left. When folding the flag, the handlers are careful to keep the\\nedges straight and to not bend the flag.\\n\\uf06c After the flag has reached the position of honor (at the head of the right column), the NCOIC\\nmarches by the most direct route to a position directly in front of the flag handler and inspects the\\nflag. The NCOIC then receives the flag and carries it held against their chest with their forearms,\\nwith the point up.\\n\\uf06c After the flag has been folded and received by the NCOIC, they position themselves between the\\nhalyard pullers and face the storage site. The NCOIC then commands Ready, FACE. The\\nmembers of the detail make the appropriate Facing movement toward the storage site. The detail\\nis then marched to the storage site.\\nNote. Once the flag has been folded (cocked hat), it is treated as a cased Color and not saluted by\\npersons meeting the flag detail. The flag will be treated with the utmost dignity and respect but\\nnot be rendered any sort of honors.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 I-3Appendix I\\nFigure I-2. Correct method of folding U.S. flag\\nDISPLAY\\nI-6. The flag of the United States represents the living country and is considered a living thing. Rules and\\ncustoms for displaying the U.S. flag, adopted by an act of Congress in 1942 and amended in 1976, are found\\nin Title 36 of the U.S. Code.\\nNote. No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right of the\\nflag of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains\\nat sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag and except as required by\\nmultinational agreements to which the United States is a signatory.\\nI-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\nI-7. The union, the field of blue with the grouping of stars representing the individual states, is the honor\\npoint and is the flag\u2019s right. When the flag is displayed, the union is always to the top and to the flag\u2019s own\\nright (the left of the observer). When carried, the flag is always free, never stretched flat or carried\\nhorizontally. In the company of other flags, the U.S. flag is always on the marching right (the flag\u2019s own\\nright) (see figure I-3), or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of that line. When flags of states\\nor localities, or pennants of societies, are grouped and displayed from staffs, the U.S. flag is in the center and\\nat the highest point of the group (see figure I-3). If all flags are displayed from staffs of the same height, the\\nflag of the United States is placed in the honor position, to the right of the other flags (to the left of the\\nobserver). When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are flown from separate staffs of the same\\nheight, they are of approximately equal size, and the U.S. flag is to the right of the others.\\nNote. When the U.S. flag is flown in conjunction with other national flags, care must be taken to\\nensure that the foreign national flag is correct and properly displayed.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 I-5Appendix I\\nFigure I-3. National Color displayed with other flags\\nI-8. The flag of the United States is never used as drapery. It is displayed hung flat against a wall or flown\\nfree from a staff as seen in figure I-4. It is not festooned over doorways or arches, tied in a bow, or fashioned\\ninto a rosette. It is not used to cover a speaker\u2019s desk or draped over the front of a platform. For those\\npurposes, bunting may be used, giving the blue of the bunting the place of honor at the top of the arrangement\\nor in the center of the rosette. Traditionally, there is one permissible departure from the rules for display of\\nthe flag of the United States: in a dire emergency, the flag may be flown upside down as a distress signal.\\nI-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\nFigure I-4.

A flag, as distinguished from a Color, is not saluted except during the ceremonies of raising and\\nlowering the flag:\\n\\uf06c U.S. flags used by the Army are classified by size as follows:\\n\\uf0a7 Garrison flag. The garrison flag is 20 feet hoist by 38 feet fly of nylon wool and is displayed\\non holidays and important occasions.\\n\\uf0a7 Post flag. The post flag is 8 feet 11 3/ -inch hoist by 17 feet fly of nylon and is used for general\\n8\\ndisplay and flown daily.\\n\\uf0a7 Field flag. The field flag is 6 feet 8 inches hoist by 12 feet fly of nylon wool and is used for\\ndisplay with the positional field flag.\\n\\uf0a7 Storm flag. The storm flag is 5 feet hoist by 9 feet 6 inches fly of nylon and is flown during\\ninclement weather.\\n\\uf0a7 Interment flag. The interment flag is 5 feet hoist by 9 feet 6 inches fly of cotton bunting.\\n\\uf06c A Color is the U.S. flag trimmed on three sides with golden yellow fringe 2 1/2 inches wide. The\\nColor is primarily for indoor display. U.S. Colors used by the Army are classified by size as\\nfollows:\\n\\uf0a7 4 feet, 4 inches hoist by 5 feet, 6 inches fly displayed with the U.S. Army flag, positional\\nColors, the Corps of Cadets Colors, 1st Battalion 3rd Infantry Colors, and the chapel flag.\\n\\uf0a7 3 feet hoist by 4 feet fly displayed with the Army field flag, distinguishing flags,\\norganizational Colors, institutional flags, and the chapel flag.\\n\\uf06c Other types of military flags include\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Colors. These are flags of organizations and certain civilian and military officials.\\n\\uf0a7 Standards. Flags of mounted units were formerly called standards.\\n\\uf0a7 Distinguished flags. These flags identify headquarters, offices, general officers, and\\norganizations, none of which is authorized organizational or individual Colors.\\n\\uf0a7 Ensign. An ensign is a rectangular flag flown from aircraft, ships, and boats.\\n\\uf0a7 Guidon. A guidon is a swallow-tailed flag carried by companies, batteries, troops, and certain\\ndetachments.\\n\\uf0a7 Pennant. A pennant is a triangular flag used for various utility purposes.\\n\\uf06c Dismounted organizations traditionally carried the Color while mounted organizations (Cavalry,\\nmechanized, and motorized) traditionally carried the standard. Colors were larger than standards.\\nUnder present regulations, both are called Colors.\\n\\uf06c The organizational Color is dipped in Salute during the playing of the U.S. national anthem, \u201cTo\\nthe Color,\u201d \u201cTaps\u201d (funerals only), and during the ceremony at reveille. It is dipped in Salute when\\nrendering honors to the organization\u2019s commander or to a person of higher grade, but at no other\\ntime. The U.S. flag is never dipped in Salute.\\n\\uf06c Until 1813, the Colors of an Infantry regiment were carried by ensigns, who were the lowest\\nranking officers of the regiment. In that year, the regulations were changed and the work was\\nentrusted to Color sergeants. NCOs carry them today.\\nARMY FLAGS\\nI-10. The U.S. Army flag is 4 feet, 4 inches hoist by 5 feet, 6 inches fly and is trimmed on three sides with\\nyellow fringe 2 \u00bd inches in width. On Flag Day, 14 June 1956, the 181st anniversary of the U.S. Army, the\\nnewly adopted U.S. Army flag was publicly unfurled at Independence Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by\\nthe Honorable Wilbur M. Brucker, Secretary of the Army. The flag, of white silk, bears an embroidered\\nreplica of the official seal of the Department of the Army in ultramarine blue (without the roman numerals).\\nA scarlet scroll inscribed \u201cUnited States Army\u201d in white is centered between the device and the ultramarine\\nblue numerals \u201c1775\u201d denoting the year the Army was founded, by action of the Continental Congress,\\n14 June 1775. The original War Office seal, constituting the central design of the flag, was authorized by the\\nContinental Congress on 8 May 1779. The U.S. Army flag bears all the streamers representing the Army\u2019s\\nI-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\ncampaigns since its inception. (When not being carried, the Yorktown streamer should always be prominently\\ndisplayed.)\\nI-11. The Army field flag was authorized in 1962 and is the same as the U.S. Army flag except that it is\\n3 feet hoist by 4 feet fly, the background is ultramarine blue, the seal is white, the scroll is white, \u201cUnited\\nStates Army\u201d is scarlet, the numerals \u201c1775\u201d are white, and streamers are not authorized. The flag is issued\\nto those organizations and headquarters not authorized the U.S. Army flag. (Units authorized issue are\\nspecified in AR 840-10.)\\nCOURTESIES BY INDIVIDUALS\\nI-12.
