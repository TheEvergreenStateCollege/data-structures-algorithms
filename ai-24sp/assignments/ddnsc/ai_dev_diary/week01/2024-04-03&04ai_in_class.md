# AI Self-Hosting In Class, Sprint 2024

## Week 01 Wednesday Morning, 2024-04-03

### Objectives:

We will be working on two simplified AI micro-systems:
- MNIST handwritten digit classifier
- Small generative pretrained model (GPT) LLM

### Considerations and Holistic Context:

- what is an AI model versus a system versus an algorithm?
- how do we collect and prepare a dataset for AI training?
- what are some parameters we can use to compare the size, quality, or other characteristics of AI models, systems, algorithms?
- mechanical and electrical considerations:
    - what is the electricity cost?
    - how much space, what temperature and ventilation are needed?
    - what is the equipment cost?
- governance considerations
    - what are some decisions that any creators / maintainers of an AI system must make, consciously or unconsciously?
    - who chooses the decision makers over time?
    - who pays for the system?
    - who benefits from the system?
- ethical considerations
    - how does training an AI on data affect people who produce / generate the data, and the people who use it?
    - does the AI have a responsibility to human creators or users?
    - do we have responsibilities to AI systems we create

### What we covered:

- [The Mechanical Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk)
- [Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Watson)
- [Ethics/Safety](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-08/understanding_artificial_intelligence_ethics_and_safety.pdf)
- Self-Hosting and Why Discussion

### Activity

**Prototype-09**:
I did this work with Dante on his laptop, we completed it and I saw him commit, but we weren't told to merge the pull
request, so it's just sitting on the repo waiting...
