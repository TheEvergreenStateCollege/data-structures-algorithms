Began work on adding functionality from mnist-loader.py (written for Python2) to
load_mnist.py, along with Paul and the rest of the class.

Copied Paul's load_mnist.py, though ran into errors running it with our 
version of network.py (`line 20, object of type zip has no len()`).

Finished typing through `update_mini_batch`, unsure how many typos were made and
only the creation of a network object was tested

image/label loader saves to a directory data/ which is ignored and might need to
be created
