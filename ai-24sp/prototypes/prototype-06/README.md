Julian and Gavin worked on this segment

Gavin's note:

I deleted the outdated files that were here previously and added the current loaders files and copied network.py from the source again, and quickly fixed the python2 outdated syntax. I wasn't able to try running the network because Paul didn't finish the loader until the end of class, and I lack the knowledge of Python to translate from Python 2 to 3.
