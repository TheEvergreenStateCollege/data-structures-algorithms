AI Lab 1:

I was able to complete the python files for loading and parsing the dataset, and ran it to produce a series of png files and an accompanying label.txt file. 

I ran into an index out of range error, which was solved by unzipping the .gz files. 

Otherwise, I made 2 errors retyping the code, first mistaking a + for a *, and then mixing up height and width in the loop within the function generating pngs. 

Finally, I spent time reading the neural network text. I retyped mnist_loader.py (I meant to retype network.py, but oh well.)
