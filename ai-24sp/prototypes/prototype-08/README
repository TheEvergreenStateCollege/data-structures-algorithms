We didn't create a gitignore file, so we've pushed uncompressed files. A gitignore still needs to be created.
We copied the code to prototype-08.py
We've lost prototype-08.py. We uploaded too many files to github, so it has omitted 50,000+ files. Sorry

Jeff and Morgan added network.py and load_mnist.py to the project. load_mnist.py will need to be updated to work with python3.
