following the notes from https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/wiki/AI%E2%80%9024sp%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9004%E2%80%9004%E2%80%90Afternoon

We got all the way through network.py, load-images.py, load-labels.py, and mnist_loadter.py

next team will have to update the mnist_loader.py because the database no longer exists.
