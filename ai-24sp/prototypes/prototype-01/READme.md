## What is Ai Self-Hosting?

AI self-hosting refers to the capability to run AI models on your own infrastructure rather than relying on cloud-based services.<br>
This can involve setting up the necessary hardware and software to train and run AI models locally.<br>
The process is autonomous to an extent but is heavily guided by the initial programming and ongoing training provided by human operators.

When we think about AI, particularly in the context of generating responses to user queries, we're often discussing models trained on large datasets that learn to predict the most likely response based on the input they receive. These AI models, like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), use statistical probabilities to generate responses that are coherent and contextually relevant to the queries they receive.




## How to run our demo

@ndeanon25 - I added the requirements.txt. You have to install these python packages to run the program. The command is pip3 install -r requirements.txt.

## Updates

@ndeanon25 - I added the loader.py, run_model.py, and run.py, train.py files. Loader replaced load_mnist.py, loader.py is from Paul's prototype. I also updated Network.py since Paul's was different. I added a screenshot of training my model. It was only a 56% accurate.
