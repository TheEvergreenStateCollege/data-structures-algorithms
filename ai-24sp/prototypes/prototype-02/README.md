## Prototype 02 week 2

there was no previous documentation so I am having to guess what was done. It seems that all the code is there that we need, but I have no clue where load_images.py came from. 

we coppied over load_mnist.py

load_mnist.py needs to be updated from prototype-00, network.py is not finished.
