I typed everything from
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#implementing_our_network_to_classify_digits
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src/network.py#L86

and

Edit#
I can run it now (◑‿◐)

## Edits from @EvergreenTor and @faulkdf:
#### 11-APR-2024

- Moved `readme` to the correct directory
- Updated `readme` filename and extention to `README.md`
- added `load_mnist.py`
- added `*.png` to `.gitignore`
- added `mnist_loader.py` (might get confusing)

### Notes:
Project isn't fully runable. The loading images works, but otherwise we couldnt get it complete. 
both `mnist_loader` and `load_mnist` arent complete. 

There is code from `prototype-00` that apparently is more up to date.
