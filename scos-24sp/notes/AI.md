# Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Track

In this track of Software Construction, we will learn
the generative AI paradigm of writing code from parameters
trained from a datasets. This is an alternate kind of
Software Construction than is often meant in Software Engineering
curricula, and we will be pioneering the integration of these
topics.

We will do this by first writing by hand (with GPT help in understanding)
a neural network, a computational learning approach inspired by
the biology of animal nervous systems, most notable, neurons in the
human brain.

Once we have a working neural network, we will learn of different
AI architectures, or ways of combining the building blocks of
neural networks and other constructs, into a learning system
that takes in data, learns parameters, and can be used to generate
novel outputs that meet our criteria. The most famous
architecture in the past year is called a Generatively-Pretrained
Transformer, or a GPT, and is famously behind AI products such as
OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, Anthropic's Claude, Facebook's LLama,
and others. The learned parameters (the model) of these GPTs
is called a Large Language Model (LLM) because they are primarily
trained on text tokens. However, much recent work has been to apply
the same approach to tokens of other inputs, such as sound (for speech synthesis
like Mozilla's TTS or Coqui),
images (such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other diffusion-based approaches).

In parallel, we will be studying questions of
* AI safety, ethics, and alignment
  * what are the dangers of AI ever harming humans directly, either materially or non-, individually or on the scale of societies
  * what are the dangers of humans relying on AI, including any biases, "poison" training data,
  * can AIs ever sustainably train themselves, perhaps after having "bootstrapped" from the human creative corpus
  * what is owed the content creators of training data that is fed into modern AIs
  * what restrictions should be placed on how AI-generated content is used, displayed, or exported
  * who owns the output of AIs, the cloud companies who host and train the data, the software companies who hire software engineers, the owners of the training data, 
* AI's impact on, and interdependence, with society
