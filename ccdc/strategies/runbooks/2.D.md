# Isolating Affected Systems and Deploying Patches

## For Linux and Windows:

### 1. Isolate Affected Systems:
- Identify compromised systems by analyzing security alerts and logs from detection tools like IDS or SIEM.
- Disconnect affected systems from the network to prevent the spread of malware or unauthorized access.

### 2. Deploy Patches:
- Use package managers like apt for Linux or Windows Update for Windows to install security patches.
- Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest patches to address known vulnerabilities exploited during the incident.

## Commands for Linux and Windows:
- **For Linux:** 
  - Update packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
  - Disconnect from the network: `sudo ifconfig <interface> down`
  
- **For Windows:** 
  - Install Windows updates: `wusa /install /quiet /norestart`
  - Disable network adapter: `Disable-NetAdapter -Name "<adapter_name>"`

By following these steps and utilizing the provided commands for both Linux and Windows environments, you can effectively isolate affected systems, prevent further harm, and deploy patches to close vulnerabilities, thereby mitigating the impact of security incidents.
