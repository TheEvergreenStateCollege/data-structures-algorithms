# Ensuring Proper Data Destruction Measures

## For Linux:

1. **Securely Erase Data:** 
    - Use tools like `shred` or `dd` to securely erase sensitive data on Linux storage devices.
    - Run commands to overwrite data multiple times to prevent data recovery.

2. **Verify Data Destruction:** 
    - Use tools like `badblocks` to verify that data has been effectively erased from storage media.
    - Perform checks to ensure no recoverable data remains on the media.

### Commands for Linux:
- To securely erase data using `shred`: `shred -n <number_of_overwrites> <file_or_device>`
- To securely erase data using `dd`: `dd if=/dev/urandom of=<file_or_device> bs=4M`
- To check for bad blocks on a device: `badblocks -v <device>`

## For Windows:

1. **Securely Erase Data:** 
    - Utilize built-in Windows tools like BitLocker Drive Encryption or Cipher to securely erase data on Windows storage devices.
    - Use third-party tools like DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke) for comprehensive data destruction.

2. **Verify Data Destruction:** 
    - Perform disk wiping procedures using tools like DBAN to ensure complete erasure of sensitive data.
    - Conduct verification checks to confirm that no recoverable data remains on the media.

### Commands for Windows:
- To use Cipher for secure deletion: `cipher /w:<path>`
- To use DBAN for disk wiping: Follow the instructions provided by the DBAN tool for secure data destruction.

By following these steps and utilizing the provided commands for both Linux and Windows environments, you can ensure proper data destruction measures for media with data storage capabilities, ther
