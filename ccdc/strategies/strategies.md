# KPI: Developing Effective Runbooks for Defending Against Attacks

## Defending Against Data Exfiltration:
1. **Implement real-time logging on critical systems and store logs securely off-device.**
2. **Utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions for activity correlation.**
3. **Ensure proper data destruction measures for media with data storage capabilities.**
4. **Develop data exfiltration incident management runbooks for a structured response** ([source](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/defending-against-data-exfiltration-threats-itsm40110)).

## Incident Response Runbooks:
1. **Monitor system logs and network traffic for irregular activity.**
2. **Activate the Incident response team upon detecting a potential incident.**
3. **Use detection tools like IDS, Firewalls, and SIEM for analysis.**
4. **Isolate affected systems to prevent further harm and deploy patches to close vulnerabilities** ([source](https://subrosacyber.com/blog/incident-response-runbook-example)).

## Defending Against Common Cyber Attack Vectors:
1. **Implement strong governance practices, identity controls, and segmented network design to prevent Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).**
2. **Maintain current backup copies to defend against ransomware attacks effectively.**
3. **Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) software to protect against cryptojacking attacks.**
4. **Follow best practices to reduce the risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC)** ([source](https://isacybersecurity.com/15-common-cybersecurity-attack-vectors-and-how-to-defend-against-them/)).

By incorporating these strategies into your runbooks, you can enhance your defense capabilities against various cyber threats in Linux and Windows-based environments as a blue team in a CCDC defense scenario.
