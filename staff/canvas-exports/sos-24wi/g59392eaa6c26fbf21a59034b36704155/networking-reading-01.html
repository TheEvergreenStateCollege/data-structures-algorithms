<p><span>objectives,&nbsp; you will be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>name the 5 layers</li>
<li>compute delays: transmission, propagation, queuing</li>
<li>explain the difference between circuit and packet switching</li>
</ul>
<h3>What you need to do</h3>
<p>Read chapter 1, but if you only have time to read 20 pages, focus on 1.1 and 1.3 for Friday. Answer the following questions about the reading:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the 5 layers of the Network Stack?</li>
<li>What are the units for the transmission delay?&nbsp;</li>
<li>For figure 1.13, how many different circuits are there for 2 opposite nodes?</li>
<li>Answer review questions: R1, R11, R12 (ignore TDM), R13. Note: the Review questions are different from the Problems.</li>
