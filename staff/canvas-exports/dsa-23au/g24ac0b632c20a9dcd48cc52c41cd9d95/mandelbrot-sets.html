<title>Assignment: Mandelbrot Sets</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>&nbsp;The Mandelbrot set is an example from mathematics of a fractal set. The actual computation involves some important computational and mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>The first is the idea of an iterated function. You start with a function of&nbsp; one variable, e.g. one that takes a double as input and produces a double. You apply the function to a starting number and then apply it again and again to the output from the previous iteration. This produces a sequence of values, and you can look at the pattern produced. A system is said to be chaotic if a small change in the input can produce a large change in the pattern.</p>
<p>The second idea is that of complex-valued functions. We discussed complex numbers in class on Thursday. They have some important mathematical properties, but our main use is that they can be represented as points in a plane and they have +, -, *, and /. The complex function used for the Mandelbrot set is a simple quadratic function that is parameterized by the starting point c.</p>
<pre>f(z) = z * z + c
</pre>
<p>Thus, we might program this as (although you don't need to make it a separate function)</p>
<pre>Complex f(Complex z, Complex c) {
   return z * z + c;
}
</pre>
<p>The property of the sequence that we are interested in is whether the output grows without bound or whether it stays within a circle of radius 2 around 0.&nbsp; More precisely, we are looking for the first iteration when the output leaves that circle. If it never exits the circle, then the result should be infinity. Since we only have finite time to run the program we choose a maximum number of iterations, and if the sequence has not left the circle in that many iterations, then we can think of that as having infinite exit time.</p>
<p>The key idea for this assignment is that different values for c will have different exit times, and the amount of computation is directly proportional to the exit time. If we are parallelizing this with multiple threads, then the amount of work can vary significantly if each thread has the same number of values for c.</p>
<p>For ease of programming, we might want to represent the values for c as a 2D array, which means that for graphical display, we need to be able to convert array coordinates to coordinates in the complex plane. Since the most interesting behavior occurs in a circle of radius 2, we will scale the array coordinates to lie in the range -2.0 to +2.0 in both the real and imaginary axes. In other words, index 0 should map to -2.0 and index (size-1) should map to either +2.0 or a value very close to that. I have uploaded a version of the code for C# and for C. You can find them in Modules -&gt; Week 7.</p>
<p>Submit a version of your code (C# or C).<br><strong>What your code should do:</strong> it should fill in the int array with the values for the corresponding points in the Complex plane. You can print out a few values. I will post code to produce an image file, so that you can better test your code.</p>
<pre>using System.Drawing;
// use Dependencies -&gt; NuGet to add System.Drawing.Common
<br>static Bitmap bmp;<br>
static void Draw_Image(Color[] colors)
        {
            for (int r = 0; r &lt; size; r++)
            {
                for (int c = 0; c &lt; size; c++)
                {

                    int indx = Math.Max(image[ r, c], 999);
                    bmp.SetPixel(r, c, colors[image[r, c]]);
                }
            }
            bmp.Save("C:/Users/weissr/Mandelbrot.bmp");
        }
        
public static void Init_Colors(int ncolors)
        {
            double inc = 255.0 / ncolors;
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; ncolors; i++)
            {
                int delta = (int) inc * i;
                colors[i] = Color.FromArgb(delta, 255, 255 - delta); // you can probably do better
