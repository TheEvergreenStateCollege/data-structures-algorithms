<title>Assignment: Week 3 Team Project and Independent Learning</title>
</head>
<body>
Goal:

Demonstrate progress on your project and team learning.

For first-time DSA students, this will be collection of your dataset in a spreadsheet or CSV file.
Discuss some questions would like to answer with this data and code can be written based on this data to answer those questions by the end of the quarter.

For upper division Computer Science students doing an independent learning contract, the project will be what you proposed to us in a one-page contract submitted in this assignment: $CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/assignments/gb2db2db99864b913b923b02aa0d81d0e

Be sure and complete that assignment first, even if you have been emailing and discussing with us in-person.

For Computer Science students doing Changemakers, this will be one of your team projects from that class.

Tasks

Copy your journal entries up to Week 3 and submit to this assignment in the text field. Write a journal entry about your progress first if you haven't done so.
List the members of your team. You need to have at least one other member.
Describe what you plan to do and learn in the next week. There must be enough detail that we will be able to tell how well you accomplished it.
