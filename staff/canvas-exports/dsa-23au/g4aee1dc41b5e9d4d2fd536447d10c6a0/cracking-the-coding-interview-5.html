</head>
<body>
<p>At the end of class (3pm)<br><br>If you are making up this assignment, set aside a 2 hour period of time when you can work uninterrupted (with rest breaks).<br><br>Submit the following here on Canvas</p>
<ul>
<li>link to your profile on HackerRank or other coding problem website</li>
<li>links to a specific problem you attempted or worked on *only* during this 2 hour period of time, with a submission<br>
<ul>
<li>Click on the "Submissions" tab on the left.</li>
<li>Choose your submission from the list provided.</li>
<li>Copy the URL in the browser and submit it on Canvas.

<ul>
<li>https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/diagonal-difference/submissions/code/356718277</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>names of any teammates that you worked with
<ul>
<li>you are encouraged to pair program on these! It is more fun and motivating, but does take work to set up a time outside of class.</li>
<li>screenshare in a voice channel on Discord (one of the study rooms) is recommended</li>
<li>when doing this, one of you should type into their Hackerrank account and share their screen</li>
<li>the other should navigate</li>
<li>trade places every 15 minutes or so, whenever you get tired, and the previous driver will narrate the code they just typed (as the new navigator) for the other person, who is the new driver.</li>
<li>repeat until you've been practicing for two hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>links to your search engine queries and GPT chats
<ul>
<li>it is okay to use information you find on Google, Stackoverflow, ChatGPT, etc. with the following conditions
<ul>
<li>you type in all the code yourself character-by-character (no copy and paste)</li>
<li>you can explain the purpose of each line of code</li>
<li>you know the correct order to type in the code, 3 lines of code / comments at a time, so that the code always compiles without errors, and that it leads to your desired submission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>describe the progress you made problems you worked on during classtime and any thoughts that come up.</li>
<li>if you have time left, repeat this with another problem of similar difficulty.</li>
