<title>Assignment: Conway&#39;s Game of Life</title>
</head>

<p>Goals</p>
<p>The goal is to understand data parallelism and parallel for-loops. In the case of Conway's game of life (GOL), the data are arranged in a 2D nxn array (matrix). The program should loop through the entire array and compute the new value at each location based on its 8 neighbors. This is done by creating a copy of the array, saving the new values in the copy, then at the end of a sweep, swapping the arrays so that the new array becomes the values for the next iteration.</p>
<p>The universe of the Game of Life is , each of which is in one of two possible states, <i>live</i> or <i>dead</i> (or <i>populated</i> and <i>unpopulated</i>, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>
