</head>
<body>
<p><strong>Independent Learning Students</strong><br><br>For independent learning students (if you are working in the Tech Incubator and working on your own project instead of DSA):</p>
<p>Prepare at least one slide summarizing progress on your project over the past four weeks, and a short 5 minute presentation to the class on Tuesday, October 24th, 10am. Relate your work to at least one data structure or algorithm (it does not have to be one that is covered in DSA curriculum). Submit here your slide(s) as a link (for example to Google Slides) or as a PDF.</p>
<p>Focus on challenges you encountered, how you overcame them, and any interesting code you wrote.<br><br>You will also be asked to evaluate all the other independent learning presentations.</p>
<p>Be prepared for 5 minutes of Q&amp;A after your talk.<br><br>10 points: level of preparation of slides and speech<br>10 points: challenges you overcame were commensurate with your skill<br>10 points: style and organization of your code (please submit here a link to an online source repository, if it's private add github: @learner-long-life and @weissri as collaborators<br>10 points: questions asked, evaluation of other presentations (submitted here)<br><br>Submission:<br>* Your slides as link to online presentation, or a PDF upload<br>* Link to your online source repository<br>* Your evaluation of the other presentations.<br><br><strong>DSA Students:</strong></p>
<p>You will be submitting a written response of each of the presentations using this rubric:<br><br>* What are three strengths of the project, including overall level of preparation of slides and speech, the complexity and originality of the project, amount of effort<br>* What is one piece of constructive criticism for an area that could use improvement?<br>* What data structures or algorithms are used, either mentioned explicitly or that you infer from the description? Be specific how they are used:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * For example, not just "linked lists" but "regions of memory appear to stored in a linked list"<br>* What are two technical questions for the presenter that come to mind as you are watching the presentation?</p>
