<p><br>1. In a sliding square puzzle, there is a grid of n x n matrix of numbered squares, and one empty square that adjacent squares can slide into.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose you want to slide the empty square from (i1,j1) to (i2,j2), fill in the following question marks to complete Java code<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (int i = ?; i ? ?, i += 1) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; slidingSquare[i][j1] = slidingSquare[?][?]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (int j = ?; j ? ?, j += 1) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; slidingSquare[i2][j] = slidingSquare[?][?]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ```<br>2. If you need a data structure needs to keep order among its elements, what abstract data types (ADTs) are good choices?<br>3. Under what circumstances might you choose a linked list vs. an array?</p>
<p>A thesaurus is a large book printed on paper that associates similar (synonyms) and dissimilar (antonyms) meanings with word spellings ("terms"). When you look up a word, you flip pages until you find one that contains the target term, you'll see about 100 other terms on the same page.</p>
<p>4. Why are the terms in alphabetical order?&nbsp;<br>5. What two data structures can you combine to implement an online version of a thesaurus? Write pseudocode for a build/create operation and a read operation<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. buildThesaurus(term1, num_synonyms1, synonym1_1, ... , num_antonyms1, antonym1_1, ... term2, num_synonym2, ..., termn, num_synonymsn, ... , antonymn_n) -&gt; thesaurus<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. lookupInThesaurus(thesaurus, targetTerm) -&gt; (antonyms: set&lt;string&gt;, synonyms: set&lt;string&gt;)<br>6. Arrange the following orders of growth from slowest growth to fastest growth<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; O(n^2), O(log n), O(n), O(sqrt(n)), O(2^n), O(1), O(n^3)<br>7. If you can only use one data structure, which ones of the below can be used to implement a sorting algorithm? If so, describe how.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a. heap<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b. linked list<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; c. binary search tree<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; d. queue</p>
