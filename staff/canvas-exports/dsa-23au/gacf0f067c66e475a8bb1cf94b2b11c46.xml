  <title>Networking in Winter</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;There was some confusion about Networking next quarter. I will be teaching Networking (4 credits) and it will be part of SOS. It can be taken as a separate thread. We will be using the Text Computer Networking by Kurose and Ross (8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition). You can rent it. It is about how the Internet works. The topics include: overview of OSI and Internet layers, application layer (http), transport layer (TCP, UDP), networking (IPv4, IPv6), link layer (Ethernet). network performance and routers&lt;/p&gt;</text>
