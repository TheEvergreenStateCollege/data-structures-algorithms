## Winter 2024

This independent learning contract describes the learning goals, job description, and responsibilities of student teaching assistants for Upper Division Computer Science (Student-Originated Software). The exact topics are subject to change as the needs of the course progresses or student interests evolve and adapt.

## Learning Goals (please update)

Alongside helping students learn Networking and Engineering for the Web:

?? wishes to learn and apply [HTMx](https://htmx.org/), a framework which unifies HTML, websockets, AJAX, CSS transitions, and other web features into a single language.

?? wishes to learn (possibly advanced AWS services like container registry, Kubernetes)

## Job Description
Student teaching assistants are asked to be responsible for:
* Watching assigned videos and doing assigned readings ahead of class, to help students. These will be posted at least one week before the watchings/readings are due.
* Playtesting assignments, labs, and quizzes. These will be posted on GitHub and Canvas at least one week before their due date.
* Holding a regular office hour each week to tutor students and help them learn. If TAs have time, they may offer additional hours to students upon request.
* Holding weekly mock interviews (20 minutes per student) and leading a group critique under faculty guidance to help students practice explaining their code, learning to use terminology confidently, and becoming more effective collaborators for each other.
* Give weekly feedback and grade student assignments on Canvas and GitHub according to faculty-provided rubric
* Organize and facilitate two demo days for the computer science community (including CSF students) at the end of Week 5 and the end of Week 10. Any current CS student may sign up to demo any project, including ILCs and projects from past quarters if they are not currently in SOS.
* Being familiar with, answering student questions on, the academic honesty and course collaboration policy.
 
TAs may record any time spent carrying out these duties on their weekly timesheets. They are only required to spend up to 7 hours each week between the two of them.

## Interactions Between Tracks
Students may be enrolled in one, two, or all three of the Front End, Infrastructure, and Networking tracks, and will be working in teams across all three tracks on their DSA final projects from fall quarter, or a new project that evolves over winter quarter.

* Front End students will be implementing a web app, with a client-side browser component
* Infrastructure students will be making the web app publicly accessible under a registered domain name, continuously integrated / deployed, reproducibly-built, with maximum uptime.
* Networking students will be analyzing the interactions between client-side and server-side components of the above teams, and helping them debug connectivity and security problems

These emulate product teams in software companies, in which engineers with different specialties divide up work and then integrate them with each other. Students who specialize in one track (e.g. Networking) may choose to take SOS again next year with a different specialization (e.g. Infrastructure).

## Suggested Textbooks by Track

TAs will receive used desk copies or PDFs of the readings, see Paul at beginning of the quarter.

## Suggested Topics (please add, Richard)
These are subject to slight modification.

| Week | Networking | Front End | Infrastructure | HTMx |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | TBD | git review, HTML, CSS | unix review, telnet, curl, nc, netstat, GitHub Pages | TBD |
| 2 | TBD | Layout and Box Model | Databases | TBD |
| 3 | TBD | Buttons and Forms | Continuous Integration | TBD |
| 4 | TBD | CSS / SVG animations | Testing | TBD |
| 5 | TBD | APIs, Auth secrets | Monitoring / alerting | TBD |
| 6 | TBD | Storage, Cookies | Docker / Containers | TBD |
| 7 | TBD | Fetch (AJAX) | AWS instances | TBD |
| 8 | TBD | D3.js | Decentralized services | TBD |
| 9 | TBD | Threejs / WebAudio / ILCs | Our own REST server | TBD |
| 10 | TBD | Final Project / Demo Day | Final Project / Demo Day | TBD |

## Deliverables
In addition to helping students with their own final projects, TAs are asked to work on a final project of their choosing (either individually or together) to demonstrate their learning of HTMx or any optional topics they've chosen. The requirements are the same for students and TAs:
* 500 lines of new original code, or original code refactorings, total for all team partners
	* includes comments, display templates, HTML, CSS, Javascript
* 50% code coverage by tests (Jest for react)
* 5 new unit tests
* README file documentation (copy over criteria from Fall Quarter)
