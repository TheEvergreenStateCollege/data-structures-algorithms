Dev Diary

We were able to do Wget Ctrl+V MNIST training models 
Then we checked the ls to see if it downloaded  
We then ran Gunzip train-image and train-label 
Then made 4 new files â€“ load_images.py, load_labels.py, network.py, and mnist_loader.py.
Network.py was written in Python2, we converted it to Python3
We changed print with print ()  and Xrange is changed to range.  
We were able to finish all of the lab? We were able to load the image and label.txt file. 




This code snippet is from network.py
```python

def __init__(self, sizes):
        """The list ``sizes`` contains the number of neurons in the
        respective layers of the network.  For example, if the list
        was [2, 3, 1] then it would be a three-layer network, with the
        first layer containing 2 neurons, the second layer 3 neurons,
        and the third layer 1 neuron.  The biases and weights for the
        network are initialized randomly, using a Gaussian
        distribution with mean 0, and variance 1.  Note that the first
        layer is assumed to be an input layer, and by convention we
        won't set any biases for those neurons, since biases are only
        ever used in computing the outputs from later layers."""
        self.num_layers = len(sizes)
        self.sizes = sizes
        self.biases = [np.random.randn(y, 1) for y in sizes[1:]]
        self.weights = [np.random.randn(y, x)
                        for x, y in zip(sizes[:-1], sizes[1:])]

    def feedforward(self, a):
        """Return the output of the network if ``a`` is input."""
        for b, w in zip(self.biases, self.weights):
            a = sigmoid(np.dot(w, a)+b)
        return a
```
