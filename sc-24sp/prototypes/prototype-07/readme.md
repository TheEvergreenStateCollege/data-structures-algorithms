Rain and Jonah had an issue the push for code last week (see bellow). 
- copied over the code from Prototype-00
- documented winning.rs and ranker.rs to make sure we understood what the logic

TODO:
- add all winning moves to the best_moves vector
- add all blocking moves to the best_moves vector
- add all moves that have yet to be placed

There's a lot wrong with this. Our git push deleted a lot of the work that we did and so it is now missing files which is causing a lot of errors. Sorry to anyone who has to work on this next.
