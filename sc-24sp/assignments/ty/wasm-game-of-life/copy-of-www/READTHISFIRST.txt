This is a copy of the www submodules that includes along with the template of the game of life.

Because it's a submodule for unknown reason, the fact that it got its own branch shows that it can't be mixed
with the main repo.

Hence I create this folder for archive reasons, there should also be a node_modules but 1 it got gitignored by
default, which is understandable, and 2 it always comes with the intialization of this template through npm init
by default as well, so it's self explanatory and don't need to get archived in.

Thank you for checking this out.
