# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Autumn 2023

Current Maven Build Status

![example workflow](https://github.com/theevergreenstatecollege/upper-division-cs/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

Students taking DSA this quarter are on two tracks, which run parallel with frequent
interaction via pair programming and mentorship.

* First-time DSA students will be responsible for completing
* Returning DSA students will be responsible for setting their own learning curriculum.

## Choice of Programming Language

All students can choose which programming language to use to complete this quarter.
The teaching staff can provide full support for Java, building on students' experience from Computer Science Foundations.

However, learning is an adventure, and there are a diverse array of programming languages,
each with a different lens on computation. You are welcome to choose any programming language
which can accept text input piped to `stdin` and returning an output on `stdout`, the two standard streams
in a UNIX shell, as this is how we will be testing your solutions. Don't worry,
99% of programming languages out there offer this feature.

## Build Status

This program is a joint effort among students and teaching staff as a Learning Organization.
For software and computer science, that means we are producing code (and tests) as artifacts
as we are learning them. The build status indicates whether our code currently compiles, and all tests are currently passing
successfully. During the quarter, this build status will fluctuate but by the end it should stay green (passing).
