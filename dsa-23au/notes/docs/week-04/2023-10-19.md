# Week 4 - Day 11
19 October 2023 - Thursday

## Morning Session

### First Hour

#### Some Fixes
* GitPod variables (Winston's fix) for privacy emails
* Change Color Theme

#### Source Control Tab
* Perhaps simpler and more visual than the command-line.
* In VSCode show stashes, branches, commits, staging and not, committing and pushing.

#### Extensions

* Java Debugger
* Draw.io

Alternate Development Setups
* IntelliJ
* Docker Desktop, VSCode with Containers
  * https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers

#### Traversal Problem

For linked lists / arrays, stacks, queues, they are linear.
There's only one way to traverse.

For trees, and later graphs, for the first time now we have multiple ways to traverse.
(And iterators become more interesting and useful).

[Write General Tree.java]


##### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Follow the first child link until you reach a leaf, then backtrack.
Q. (What data structure do you need to backtrack?)

We can also use recursion to do the backtracking.

##### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Follow all the sibling child links first, put the grandchildren links into a new datastructure,
then iterate.
Q. (What data structure do you need to keep adding grandchildren and great*children to a to-visit list?)

Q. What are the tradeoffs of DFS vs. BFS?


#### The Search Problem

On Tuesday, we talked about the problem of looking for a name in a list.
If the list is sorted a certain way, this task is easier (can be done more efficiently).
How much more efficiently? Use Big-Oh notation.

More formally, if we have a history of calls (a trace), and we only show the
lines related to `key1`, here is an *invariant* for searching dictionaries.

```
1. Dictionary D = new Dictionary
2. ...
3. D.search(key1) -> null
4. ...
5. D.insert(key1, value1)
6. ...
7. D.search(key1) -> value1
8. ...
9. D.remove(key1)
10. ...
11. D.search(key1) -> null
```
That is, if we search for a key before it's in the dictionary, we won't find it (its value).
If we search for it after we add it, but before we remove it (if ever), we will find the original value.
If we search for it after we remove it, again we won't find it.

This is the beginning of a unit test! (One of you will write this later).

This is related to *traversals* which are designed to be more efficient (logarithmic depth)
in a Binary Search Tree, which can be used to both sort and a create a database-like
index, and then use that index for lookups.

 
### Second Hour

## Afternoon Session


### First Hour

Divide Into Pairs Today:

1. Write Unit Tests for Stack, based on Weiss book
2. Write Unit Tests for HeapWrapper, based on Weiss book
3. Modifying the NameCrawler to be a LifeCrawler, to crawl the tree of life 
   * https://www.onezoom.org/life.html?vis=polytomy
5. Create a UML class diagram from the DMV Design, using the DrawIO extension in VSCode / GitPod
6. Writing an English language / pseudocode version of DMV Design
7. Creating the code again from either or both the UML class diagram and English / pseudocode. Compare with original.
8. Build System / Maven Integration
9. Binary Search Tree.findMin (use recursion)
10. Binary Search Tree.findMax (use recursion)

### Second Hour

Continue working on closing PRs, merging branches.
