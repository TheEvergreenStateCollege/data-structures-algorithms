# Co-Creation Week 2

Add your sentences below here.
Some notes about Reading Wk 2(Hiraeth):

1)It is okay and normal to stutter during an interview.
2)Any Hash Map can have a collision, and there are many ways of solving it.
3)Listening is the first step to solving a problem.
4)Data structures can either be linked or continuous.
5)The dictionary data type gives access to data items.

Cracking the Coding Interview (McDowell)
•	I think, for me personally I’m somewhere in the middle of page 31. The market right now looks really bleak and it seems like you need to be related to someone already working at the company to actually get noticed.
•	Fundamental data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, serve as the backbone for numerous algorithms and operations.
•	Understanding hash table collisions, wherein multiple keys map to the same index, is pivotal for optimizing hash table performance.
The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena, 3rd edition)
•	Contiguous arrays, while providing O(1) access, have limitations when resizing.
•	Linked lists cater to dynamic data storage requirements, offering efficient insertions and deletions at the expense of O(n) random access.
•	Stacks, with their LIFO nature, and queues, with their FIFO characteristic, are quintessential data structures for specific problem-solving paradigms.
•	Hash maps or dictionaries facilitate rapid key-value look-ups, with efficiency hinging on a robust hash function and effective collision handling.

Crack the Coding Interview
- PERSONAL GOAL: Build a website, expand network and learn a few more languages. 
Also consider taking an intership.

- TIP: Make sure to listen to problems carefully and correctly, draw out solution, 
brute force the solution, optimize, double check and then implement.

The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)

- Data structures are classifed as either contiguous or linked.
Depending on whether they are based on arrays or pointers:

- <ins>contigously allocated structures</ins> are composed of single slabs of memory and include arrays, matrices, heaps and hash tables

- <ins>linked data structures</ins> are composed of distincit chunks of memory bound together by pointers including lists trees and graph adjaceny lists.


<b>ARRAYS</b>

- Structures of fixed size data records such that each element can be effciently located by its index. An example given is a street full of houses. 

<b>STACKS AND QUEUES</b>

- Containers are distinguished by the particular retrieval order they support.
	- Stacks: Last in, First out, push to insert, pop return (and remove) top item.
	- Queues: First in, First out, put and get operations enqueue and dequeue

<b>DICTIONARY</b>

- Permits access to data items by content. you stick an item into dictionary
so you can find it when you need it
	- SEARCH: given a search key, a pointer to the element in dictionary
	- INSERT: given a data item, add it to the set in dictionary
	- DELETE: given a pointer to a give data item in the dictionary, remove it
	- MAX OR MIN: retrieve the item with the largest or smallest key 
	- PREDECESSOR OR SUCCESSOR: retrieve the item whose key is immeditaly before or after in sorted order.
