# Week 5 Co-Creation

Some Notes from the week 5 folder on Co-creation notes:

Excellent example of co-creation statements

State what you believe is true about computer science, that you think will pull others forward
Give an update on your project thinking and design, allows others to help you or suggest resources
Other examples:

A good place to ask questions about computer science or programming to advance your skills further
A good place to check your understanding by trying out a statement about computer science or programming.
Repeating back statements you think are important from the book, class, or online resources.
Make opinionated statements about computer science or programming ("My favorite is because of ") that you think will help other students learn more effectively, save them time, help them do more, or give them a way of thinking that you find helpful.

I’ve learned a lot about different python libraries that focus on neurology. Neo and MNE are two that I’ve been working closely with for the past few weeks. I was having issues with pandas “4 values expected on line 19, only 3 found”, a friend helped me fix it by opening the original csv in vs code instead of the renamed version. It apparently got corrupted when I renamed the file, causing a bunch of weird issues. Now it prints.

Reflection: So far, I have learned more java syntax effectively than in the past few years combined, even when recommended to me by my old manager. I was in a group called "learning effective java" but even that didn't help.  I have also learned that there are far more data structures than I suspected previously and learned that it is important to evaluate them vs just picking the first structure that seems to get the job done. I have learned a great deal about the fundamentals which was my primary reason for taking this class. For problems, I have had problems with not having a modern enough computer to deal with the loss of GitPod access but I resolved that by spinning up an EC2 instance Linux machine. I also run into blank screen blockage when trying to sort out java and problems. I also had issues with discord but have since resolved them.

Week 5 - AI for Learning
How do you think the increasing availability and quality of AI chat and large learning models will affect the software industry in the near future? 
  
It is inevitable that AI will have an impact on the software industry. From enabling engineers to easily create more robust testing to copy-pasting incomplete, to becoming a sort of copyeditor for code writing. In my experience, one of the biggest obstacles to innovation is code rot. Engineers for years past writing code that is hard to read or in production so impossible to test changes. With ChatGPT, I could see a vital use-case where an engineer takes a bit of code and asks ChaptGPT to explain it and to add comments. You could then take those comments and update the code which is sometimes enough to take an unreadable code base to expand to a wider audience. Based on what I have seen in the classroom with ChpatGPT, I look back on those hours toiling over code and looking for answers in posts on stack overflow. The speed and accuracy of code-based questions seems very on point with the right questions. 
  
What will this mean for the future of software engineers? It is impossible to predict but if history is any prologue, then we can look back on similar instances of technology threatening a workforce. One may think of solar versus fossil fuels but that is more complex than a invention that threatened a single profession. As I recall from a radio broadcast snippet from NPR (KNKX, October 2023) a similar panic arose with the invention of the calculator. Mathematicians were alarmed that it would erase the need for them. But as the decades rolled on, this proved false where the calculator helped make better mathematicians reduce the time it took and improve the accuracy to do complex calculations.

#6 Hackerthon prelim-notes:
	• What are you looking forward to, or could you look forward to, in the hackathon?
		○ Looking forward to experiencing a hackathon in a different way.
		○ Looking forward to some solid coding session which is one of my fav things
	• What are some concerns you have or challenges we might encounter in the hackathon?
		○ Concerns is possibly getting distracted or going down a rabbit hole
	• What well-defined, one-weeks' worth of difficulty piece of your final project do you hope to complete for your hackathon submission / entry?
		○ Building the data structure and the methods to answer our questions
	• What resources, work, or tools (software or otherwise) do you think all of us will need to succeed in the hackathon, that we can prepare in advance?
		○ Coffee and lots of it. Maybe a set of benchmarks, make sure everyone is up to speed and have a good idea where to save their work. Build before and after each edit or break, save frequently if making progress.
	• How will you judge whether the week was a successful experience or not?
		○ I would like to complete the 2 of 3 major benchmarks and have a working query tool by the end. Already have data and have a working csv reader that prints to the console.
