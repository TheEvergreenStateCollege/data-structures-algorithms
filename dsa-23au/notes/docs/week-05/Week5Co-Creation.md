# Week 5 Co-Creation

Some Notes from the week 5 folder on Co-creation notes:

Excellent example of co-creation statements

State what you believe is true about computer science, that you think will pull others forward
Give an update on your project thinking and design, allows others to help you or suggest resources
Other examples:

A good place to ask questions about computer science or programming to advance your skills further
A good place to check your understanding by trying out a statement about computer science or programming.
Repeating back statements you think are important from the book, class, or online resources.
Make opinionated statements about computer science or programming ("My favorite is because of ") that you think will help other students learn more effectively, save them time, help them do more, or give them a way of thinking that you find helpful.

I’ve learned a lot about different python libraries that focus on neurology. Neo and MNE are two that I’ve been working closely with for the past few weeks. I was having issues with pandas “4 values expected on line 19, only 3 found”, a friend helped me fix it by opening the original csv in vs code instead of the renamed version. It apparently got corrupted when I renamed the file, causing a bunch of weird issues. Now it prints.

Reflection: So far, I have learned more java syntax effectively than in the past few years combined, even when recommended to me by my old manager. I was in a group called "learning effective java" but even that didn't help.  I have also learned that there are far more data structures than I suspected previously and learned that it is important to evaluate them vs just picking the first structure that seems to get the job done. I have learned a great deal about the fundamentals which was my primary reason for taking this class. For problems, I have had problems with not having a modern enough computer to deal with the loss of GitPod access but I resolved that by spinning up an EC2 instance Linux machine. I also run into blank screen blockage when trying to sort out java and problems. I also had issues with discord but have since resolved them.

Trinity Hyre (Hiraeth_Awaits) :
Reflection: Over these past weeks, I have learned more about java then I thought I would. Algorithms have been hard to understand for me, and since I am taking the Codecademy Pro Career path for computer science, I will go over it again in the next month or so. This class, thusfar, has helped kickstart my learning journey. I am confident that when it is time for me to redo Algorithms and data structures, I will have a basic enough understanding to work through it efficiently. I personally enjoyed learning how to make our own personal project spaces within the main branch, it was very helpful to go step by step with that process.
What are you looking forward to, or could you look forward to, in the hackathon?
Possibly learning more about the world of hacking.
What are some concerns you have or challenges we might encounter in the hackathon?
I feel as if it might be difficult for me to keep up with others, as I am not that skilled or informed with hacking.
What well-defined, one-weeks' worth of difficulty piece of your final project do you hope to complete for your hackathon submission / entry?
I hope to input the Spotify data that I collected, along with my groupmates, into an excel sheet to sort it. Then start on creating a program to sort it automatically.
What resources, work, or tools (software or otherwise) do you think all of us will need to succeed in the hackathon, that we can prepare in advance?
Caffiene and sleep. 
How will you judge whether the week was a successful experience or not?
If I at least tried to complete something, wrong or right, I will know I at least tried my best; therefore succeeding.


Jonathan Rodriguez (JonR2002): Increasing the availability and quality of AI chat could provide signficant advancement for the software industry. These developments could bring about a range of changes, such as the automation of customer support, the creation of more user-friendly interfaces, content generation, tailored user experiences, enhanced data analysis, and improvements in software development processes. AI will also find applications in fields like security, healthcare, education, and entertainment. While these advancements could offer clear benefits in terms of efficiency and personalization, they also introduce challenges, including ethical concerns, regulatory considerations, and the potential for workforce displacement. To fully leverage the capabilities of AI models, the software industry must address these issues and invest in ongoing education for its workforce. 
I am also very excited for the hackathon in a couple of weeks because of the oppurtunites that can arise from this. I am also very worried because this is also my first hackathon/coding competition or any of the sorts. I dont know what to expect apart from what I have heard from my other fellow classmates. Im hoping that the hackathon can harden my programming and coneptual computer science skills as well as providing concise and adoptable methodologies. 

Stella Parker (whereismyprozac):
In the near future I think chat won’t affect the software industry in a negative way, it is still in its very early stages despite being so advanced. Right now, it feels like chat will become another tool just like google but better. It’s even creating more jobs; we’ll need people to engineer and test prompts and always oil the machine. The image generating ai is what I am more worried about. Even though it’s still mediocre, in a few years it will become too powerful. We are already struggling in the age of conspiracies and disinformation, image generating ai will just make everything much, much worse. We are already in a pit of despair that is filling up faster than we can recognize and it’s probably too late.
To avoid boredom, I chose my own language to write my project in. It feels more overwhelming to work with others sometimes. I hate explaining what I want from projects to other people and there’s no guarantee that they will know how to do what you are trying to accomplish. As for in class work, I wish there were a lot more written instruction, or any at all. Some people have issues processing auditory information and it sucks to have to guess or ask the person next to you who also doesn’t know what’s going on because the projector is impossible to see and there are no written instructions. 
I am not looking forward to the hackathon and I don’t have any concerns about it. I’ll probably submit my print results. The entire internet will be used for the hackathon. This week will be a success when it ends, and I haven’t been hit by a car.

Nathan Deanon(ndeanon25):
      The increase of availability and quality of AI chat will help speed up our technological advances. AI does open many different outlets for people if used right. While people do not have to think of the technical aspect of coding, developers can focus more on bigger picture aspects like how the code works, and what can be improved. This will come with many downfalls like I believe many entry level jobs like doing SQL database, will be harder to find since many companies will just use AI for these. In retrospect, this has happened multiple times throughout history. It is about adapting to the directory of where the software industry is headed. Workers in the software industry will have to update their skills and be able integrate AI into their work. This is even stated by IBM that, “AI will not completely replace humans, but those who use AI will replace those who do not.” AI will become an important tool that will be needed to work in this industry. This shift will disrupt the current job flow, it will create multiple new jobs. It is even predicted by the World Economic Forum that AI and automation “will disrupt 85 million jobs globally by 2025, creating 97 million new roles.” It will force humans and machines to work together but however widened the skill gap with the likeliness of “44% of workers needing reskilling by 2028”. 
      For my learning efforts to be on the right level of engagement, there have been multiple guidelines I have set for myself. It is easier to just copy and paste the code that ChatGPT writes down or some code I find online, but I want to be able to understand and see how the code functions in my head. I must be able to visualize how this certain data structure is used or how this algorithm calculates an answer. I try to find flow but creating the balance that the article talks about.  The balance between a challenge and my skill. I enjoy understanding algorithms and problem solving these challenges, but there are points where it feels out of my skill reach. This is the point where I feel overwhelmed and need to take a step back. I try to avoid copying and pasting implementations of methods, so I just start from scratch and build it up slowly. That is my philosophy has been lately, I am moving at my own pace and trying to break everything down into steps. This helps with seeing how the big picture.
