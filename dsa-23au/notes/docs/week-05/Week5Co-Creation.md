# Week 5 Co-Creation

Some Notes from the week 5 folder on Co-creation notes:

Excellent example of co-creation statements

State what you believe is true about computer science, that you think will pull others forward
Give an update on your project thinking and design, allows others to help you or suggest resources
Other examples:

A good place to ask questions about computer science or programming to advance your skills further
A good place to check your understanding by trying out a statement about computer science or programming.
Repeating back statements you think are important from the book, class, or online resources.
Make opinionated statements about computer science or programming ("My favorite is because of ") that you think will help other students learn more effectively, save them time, help them do more, or give them a way of thinking that you find helpful.

I’ve learned a lot about different python libraries that focus on neurology. Neo and MNE are two that I’ve been working closely with for the past few weeks. I was having issues with pandas “4 values expected on line 19, only 3 found”, a friend helped me fix it by opening the original csv in vs code instead of the renamed version. It apparently got corrupted when I renamed the file, causing a bunch of weird issues. Now it prints.

Reflection: So far, I have learned more java syntax effectively than in the past few years combined, even when recommended to me by my old manager. I was in a group called "learning effective java" but even that didn't help.  I have also learned that there are far more data structures than I suspected previously and learned that it is important to evaluate them vs just picking the first structure that seems to get the job done. I have learned a great deal about the fundamentals which was my primary reason for taking this class. For problems, I have had problems with not having a modern enough computer to deal with the loss of GitPod access but I resolved that by spinning up an EC2 instance Linux machine. I also run into blank screen blockage when trying to sort out java and problems. I also had issues with discord but have since resolved them.

Trinity Hyre (Hiraeth_Awaits) :
Reflection: Over these past weeks, I have learned more about java then I thought I would. Algorithms have been hard to understand for me, and since I am taking the Codecademy Pro Career path for computer science, I will go over it again in the next month or so. This class, thusfar, has helped kickstart my learning journey. I am confident that when it is time for me to redo Algorithms and data structures, I will have a basic enough understanding to work through it efficiently. I personally enjoyed learning how to make our own personal project spaces within the main branch, it was very helpful to go step by step with that process.
What are you looking forward to, or could you look forward to, in the hackathon?
Possibly learning more about the world of hacking.
What are some concerns you have or challenges we might encounter in the hackathon?
I feel as if it might be difficult for me to keep up with others, as I am not that skilled or informed with hacking.
What well-defined, one-weeks' worth of difficulty piece of your final project do you hope to complete for your hackathon submission / entry?
I hope to input the Spotify data that I collected, along with my groupmates, into an excel sheet to sort it. Then start on creating a program to sort it automatically.
What resources, work, or tools (software or otherwise) do you think all of us will need to succeed in the hackathon, that we can prepare in advance?
Caffiene and sleep. 
How will you judge whether the week was a successful experience or not?
If I at least tried to complete something, wrong or right, I will know I at least tried my best; therefore succeeding.


Jonathan Rodriguez (JonR2002): Increasing the availability and quality of AI chat could provide signficant advancement for the software industry. These developments could bring about a range of changes, such as the automation of customer support, the creation of more user-friendly interfaces, content generation, tailored user experiences, enhanced data analysis, and improvements in software development processes. AI will also find applications in fields like security, healthcare, education, and entertainment. While these advancements could offer clear benefits in terms of efficiency and personalization, they also introduce challenges, including ethical concerns, regulatory considerations, and the potential for workforce displacement. To fully leverage the capabilities of AI models, the software industry must address these issues and invest in ongoing education for its workforce. 
I am also very excited for the hackathon in a couple of weeks because of the oppurtunites that can arise from this. I am also very worried because this is also my first hackathon/coding competition or any of the sorts. I dont know what to expect apart from what I have heard from my other fellow classmates. Im hoping that the hackathon can harden my programming and coneptual computer science skills as well as providing concise and adoptable methodologies. 

Stella Parker (whereismyprozac):
In the near future I think chat won’t affect the software industry in a negative way, it is still in its very early stages despite being so advanced. Right now, it feels like chat will become another tool just like google but better. It’s even creating more jobs; we’ll need people to engineer and test prompts and always oil the machine. The image generating ai is what I am more worried about. Even though it’s still mediocre, in a few years it will become too powerful. We are already struggling in the age of conspiracies and disinformation, image generating ai will just make everything much, much worse. We are already in a pit of despair that is filling up faster than we can recognize and it’s probably too late.
To avoid boredom, I chose my own language to write my project in. It feels more overwhelming to work with others sometimes. I hate explaining what I want from projects to other people and there’s no guarantee that they will know how to do what you are trying to accomplish. As for in class work, I wish there were a lot more written instruction, or any at all. Some people have issues processing auditory information and it sucks to have to guess or ask the person next to you who also doesn’t know what’s going on because the projector is impossible to see and there are no written instructions. 
I am not looking forward to the hackathon and I don’t have any concerns about it. I’ll probably submit my print results. The entire internet will be used for the hackathon. This week will be a success when it ends, and I haven’t been hit by a car.

Torsten Spieler: How do you think the increasing availability and quality of AI chat and large learning models will affect the software industry in the near future? I think Chat GPT and other ai software will eliminate a lot of head aches for humans. For example, for my project instead of doing a lot of thinking on where to start and how my program should look, chat gpt gives me ideas and already gets me a starter class for my project or an idea of one I can use. I still think humans are needed to test the programs and keep things runign smooth etc, but ai will serve as a big helper and eliminates a lot of headaches when trying to solve a problem.
