# Week 5 Co-Creation

Some Notes from the week 5 folder on Co-creation notes:

Excellent example of co-creation statements

State what you believe is true about computer science, that you think will pull others forward
Give an update on your project thinking and design, allows others to help you or suggest resources
Other examples:

A good place to ask questions about computer science or programming to advance your skills further
A good place to check your understanding by trying out a statement about computer science or programming.
Repeating back statements you think are important from the book, class, or online resources.
Make opinionated statements about computer science or programming ("My favorite is because of ") that you think will help other students learn more effectively, save them time, help them do more, or give them a way of thinking that you find helpful.

I’ve learned a lot about different python libraries that focus on neurology. Neo and MNE are two that I’ve been working closely with for the past few weeks. I was having issues with pandas “4 values expected on line 19, only 3 found”, a friend helped me fix it by opening the original csv in vs code instead of the renamed version. It apparently got corrupted when I renamed the file, causing a bunch of weird issues. Now it prints.

Reflection: So far, I have learned more java syntax effectively than in the past few years combined, even when recommended to me by my old manager. I was in a group called "learning effective java" but even that didn't help.  I have also learned that there are far more data structures than I suspected previously and learned that it is important to evaluate them vs just picking the first structure that seems to get the job done. I have learned a great deal about the fundamentals which was my primary reason for taking this class. For problems, I have had problems with not having a modern enough computer to deal with the loss of GitPod access but I resolved that by spinning up an EC2 instance Linux machine. I also run into blank screen blockage when trying to sort out java and problems. I also had issues with discord but have since resolved them.

Reflection: Over these past weeks, I have learned more about java then I thought I would. Algorithms have been hard to understand for me, and since I am taking the Codecademy Pro Career path for computer science, I will go over it again in the next month or so. This class, thusfar, has helped kickstart my learning journey. I am confident that when it is time for me to redo Algorithms and data structures, I will have a basic enough understanding to work through it efficiently. I personally enjoyed learning how to make our own personal project spaces within the main branch, it was very helpful to go step by step with that process.
What are you looking forward to, or could you look forward to, in the hackathon?
Possibly learning more about the world of hacking.
What are some concerns you have or challenges we might encounter in the hackathon?
I feel as if it might be difficult for me to keep up with others, as I am not that skilled or informed with hacking.
What well-defined, one-weeks' worth of difficulty piece of your final project do you hope to complete for your hackathon submission / entry?
I hope to input the Spotify data that I collected, along with my groupmates, into an excel sheet to sort it. Then start on creating a program to sort it automatically.
What resources, work, or tools (software or otherwise) do you think all of us will need to succeed in the hackathon, that we can prepare in advance?
Caffiene and sleep. 
How will you judge whether the week was a successful experience or not?
If I at least tried to complete something, wrong or right, I will know I at least tried my best; therefore succeeding.
