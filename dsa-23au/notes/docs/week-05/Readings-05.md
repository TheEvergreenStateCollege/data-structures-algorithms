# Readings Week 5
and problem-solving

Create a new file in your personal Maven projects to solve the problems below in Java,
or another language of your choice.

You can add your solutions as static functions to `App.java`, and tests that call them
in `AppTest.java`.

## Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th ed., by McDowell (Green Book)

* Chapter 10: Sorting and Searching
  * pp. 146-149
  * Problems 10.2, 10.6, 10.10
* Chapter 8: Recursion, Dynamic Programming
  * pp. 130-134
  * Problems 8.1, 8.5, 8.6

* Program Management and Product Management Roles
  * pp. 16-17
* The DevRel role https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ3w_jec1v8&t=716s watch until 13:28
  * What makes a person suited for DevRel or evangelism?

* What makes a person suited to (T)PM or devrel work, and how would you enter this field or specifically get internships for it?
* What is the difference or similarities with other kinds of technical roles?
* (you may use Google or message someone on LinkedIn with the role that you want)
  
## The Algorithm Design Manual, 3rd ed. by Skiena (Red Book)

* Section 3.9, pp. 98-102
* Chapter 4 Sorting pp. 109-116, p. 124, pp. 127-139
* Problems 3-37, 4-1, 4-22, 4-28

## Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java

* Section 7.1-7.2
* Choose only *one* of the following sections. Announce your choice in the Discord channel for this class
  * 7.4 Shellsort
  * 7.5 Heapsort
  * 7.6 Mergesort
  * 7.7 Quicksort
  * 7.11 Bucket / radix sorts

You'll be implementing the chosen sort in class in a team. It helps to prepare beforehand
by writing out the pseudsocode for the algorithm, and dividing it up into different parts.
