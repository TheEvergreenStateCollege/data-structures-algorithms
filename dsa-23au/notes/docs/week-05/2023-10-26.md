# Morning Session


## 1st Hour

We are moving onto our second group of algorithms which are not really tied to a data structure: Sorting

The problem of sorting is:
given an input list with no guarantees on order,
and a way to compare any two items:

`L = { x_0, x_1, ... , x_{n-1} }`

return an output list with all items in ascending order

`L = A(L) = { x'_0, x'_1, ... x'_{n-1} }`

that is

` x'_0 <= x'_1 <= ... <= x'_{n-1} `

### Sorting

Sorting is a pre-requisite for many other problems, including

* searching (using bisection)
* successor / predecessor
* scheduling

it can also be used for artistic purposes 

* pixel sorting
* sounds of sorting
