On Tuesday, we discussed fundamental algorithm principle.
'Algorithms take state where invariant is true, then outputs invariant as true.'
On Thursday, we uploaded a dataset to upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/arrays-link/src/main/GhostTowns.CSV
Need to push/pull gitpod.
We discussed possible project ideas.what are we going to learn as a team
-- faulkdf-dawsonwhi --
Paul is cryptogoth.

we need more practice with git and gitpod and github.

SSH keys are confusing and I just want to use my VS code not GitPods'.

we are lost but so is everyone else so its okay.

I still don't know what to make a list of.

We learned that data structures are found commonly in everday life.

They are used to organize data.

Everyone has their own way of setting things up.

Algorithms are processes that take an input state and put out an output state.

I'm excited for this quarter. I personally haven't applied anything from CML to DSA.
Being incentivized by credits to talk to the nearest person is something? Either way,
I am happy to be here. Thank you.

They will always have an invariant, which is a known stating state.
1. For the first week, I have and still am learning how to navigate github and gitpod.-Torsten
2. Familiarization with GIT is helpful for the first two days of class to reduce the confusion one experiences.
3. Working with other people helps solve issues better versus working alone, Especially for new people. It is much more fun to code with others, solo is made for sleepless nights.
4. A refresher online course before class on Java would be beneficial.
5. Collaboration is much more rewarding in person than remotely.
what are we going to learn as a team

Change makers lab is from 1pm -5pm 
Is this classs monday as well? Yes this class is Mnday Tuesday Thursday
Taking this Course has already Changed my life !
I was choosing to work a job from 8am- 4pm runing netwrok data abling for $26 an hour but chose this class instead I am very very greatful

Readjusting work to fit around this class was wise.
Learning how to work Gitpod/Github is hard.
I need to get blue light glasses to protect my eyes.
Bringing water is a great idea so I can focus.
I consume caffeine in order to stay awake, but it would be better to drink Matcha than Coffee.

I took the Changemaker Lab in Fall 2022 and I learned lots of leaderships skills and workshopping skills. I love Destiny 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog. I cant wait to buy my new GPU so I can do more in programming and designs/modeling. I am excited to graduate this year with BS and get my cybersecurity. I am also excited to further my skills at game development.

////FOR OCT 5 assignment This past week, I had to brush up on my programming and psuedocode skills that we learned in CSF. I have grown pretty comfortable with arrays and linked lists. My syntax skills have gotten better as I have been using Java API (I urge you to use that as a tool). I have also been practicing call function because that is a great skill to learn with arrays and linked lists. Also ALWAYS PUT COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE!!!

we need more practice with git and gitpod and github.

SSH keys are confusing and I just want to use my VS code not GitPods'.

we are lost but so is everyone else so its okay.

I still don't know what to make a list of.

Sometimes there is confusion, and teammates having a different viewpoint corrects for missing information in conversation.


/// faulkdf \\\
This class so far is *incredbly* chaotic. I don't belive that I have ever taken a class here at Evergreen that is this level of "all over the place."
Code, and coding has never been my strong suit, but having to do a fair amount of it has been a good refresher. \
Many times, I really feel as if I am totall lost in class, however I'm pretty sure that theres a fair amount of us that feel the same. 
Skills are improving on how to do everthing in a co-created repository, I still worry that I am often doing something wrong.

Caffiene is my best friend.
There will usually be an invarient of some kind.
Nobody knows what we are doing, but it can be fun to pair with others to learn.
Being lost is oddly helping me learn more, if that makes sense.

For those who would like to know, a hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. I like to split hash code into a 3 step process (Compute, Map, Avoid Collisions). There are many ways to deal hash code collisions such as linked lists, search trees, and linear probing. A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science. Think of it as a stack of plates where you can only remove or add plates to the top of the stack.
