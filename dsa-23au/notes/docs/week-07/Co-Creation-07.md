Add your responses below please.
1. Dante and I leanred how to cherry pick old commits from old branches.
2. Dante and I discused what are good data strucutres to use for his final project. 
3. Stacks, queues, or maybe a hashmap.
4. Forking in github is making a copy of the whole repository so you can do your own things without messing with the main/original repository.
5. Both Dante and I had issues attending the hackhathan events. For me, either I could not find it or they never went live even though I got an email to check in for the event. The video player for Dante would not load.
