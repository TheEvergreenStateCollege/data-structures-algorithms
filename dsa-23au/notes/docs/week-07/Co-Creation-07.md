# Co-Creation Week 7

Add your responses below please.

Dylana and Nathan McLaughlin,

During the first portion I, Nathan explained how my project reads through the CSV data.
While stepping throuhg my drving data project, we noticed that the keys to access the data are long and would be improved by shortening the access key. We also noticed a bug while using an option in the program.

Lastly, we notcied that under one of the options to display data, that the data doesn't descrbe if it is for both driver or just one.

Then during the second portion I, Dylana explained the methods we were considering using to reconstruct and read the mRNA data for the smarty-plants group and what the pipeline would involve. We discussed different programs and tools used in bioinformatics to clean-up and then read data, as well as potential problems.

We concluded that some of the first step forwards would involve making sure the data was availible to work with on GitHub/GitPod, or that we had something to run.
