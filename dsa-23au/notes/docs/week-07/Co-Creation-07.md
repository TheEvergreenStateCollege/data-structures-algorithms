# Co-Creation Week 7
Hey, it'd be really, really cool if you would put assignments on canvas. It's frustrating to have to fish through github to try and find everything. I've been in and out of the hospital all week and didn't know that we had to submit a whole project into that hackathon. Not trying to be an ultra bitch but.. yeah. Thanks. Best wishes.

Harlee and Devin
- My program partner helped me come up with some more ideas to implement in my code by asking questions to further understand each others projects. 
- We edited and narrowed down the size of the CSV file Harlee was working with, from 45k+ lines to a little over a 1000. 
- Harlee needed to clean up main and make things more interactive in the terminal. 
- Watching program pair partner work is helpful and sheds light on how other students work. 
- My program partner helped me stay focused on my project, during the time allocated for my code.
