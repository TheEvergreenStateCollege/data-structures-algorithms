# Co-Creation Week 7
Paul / Stella Co creation week 7
Dear Abby:
Paul is a Python wizard an he is very patient. He tried to help me with a weird error in my project, unfortunately the error was too weird. I may have picked up too much "white noise" when collecting my data and it might be causing issues. We'll find a workaround. Pauls project looks great.
Add your responses below please.


Harlee and Devin
- My program partner helped me come up with some more ideas to implement in my code by asking questions to further understand each others projects. 
- We edited and narrowed down the size of the CSV file Harlee was working with, from 45k+ lines to a little over a 1000. 
- Harlee needed to clean up main and make things more interactive in the terminal. 
- Watching program pair partner work is helpful and sheds light on how other students work. 
- My program partner helped me stay focused on my project, during the time allocated for my code.

We worked on my plans for my final project. These are my plans for my final project. I will have to implement methods for Tree transversal, Filtering words based on user choices using Hangman logic. I am thinking that I will have to create a BST class. It will make the node of the BST represent a word from the dictionary. When the user chooses a letter, traverse the BST to identify words that do not contain the chosen letter. This will keep a list of candidate words (initially containing all words) and narrow down this list as the user makes more letter choices. This continues the game based on the candidate's words until either the user guesses the word or runs out of attempts. My other idea is to investigate binary search for an array rather than putting it into a tree to simplify it. I will probably make a new list every time that the user chooses a letter and avoid the letter.

We have learned alot about Java language in a short amount of time, In week 7 learning of the in and outs of Java programming , GitHub , GitPod and repositories has brought alot of satisfaction to a once daunting task. Now we are towards the final stretch with our final projects coming up and its important to remind ourselves to take a deep breath because the answer we're looking for may be right under our faces the main goal is to keep learning and have fun coding !
