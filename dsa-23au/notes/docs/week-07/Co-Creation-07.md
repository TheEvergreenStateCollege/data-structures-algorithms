# Co-Creation Week 7
Hey, it'd be really, really cool if you would put assignments on canvas. It's frustrating to have to fish through github to try and find everything. I've been in and out of the hospital all week and didn't know that we had to submit a whole project into that hackathon. Not trying to be an ultra bitch but.. yeah. Thanks. Best wishes.
Add your responses below please.


1. if you have a sorted list it might be easier to do a normal binary search than have the data sorted in a binary search tree
2. spotify sure does track a lot of data from you
3. chatGPT already is taught on stolen information and now you are also the product
4. programming is really just a lot of problem solving and not that much math like everyone likes to make it out to be
5. having to do work on github and then again on canvas is annoying
