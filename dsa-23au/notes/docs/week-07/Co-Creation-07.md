# Co-Creation Week 7
Hey, it'd be really, really cool if you would put assignments on canvas. It's frustrating to have to fish through github to try and find everything. I've been in and out of the hospital all week and didn't know that we had to submit a whole project into that hackathon. Not trying to be an ultra bitch but.. yeah. Thanks. Best wishes.
Add your responses below please.
1. Dante and I leanred how to cherry pick old commits from old branches.
2. Dante and I discused what are good data strucutres to use for his final project. 
3. Stacks, queues, or maybe a hashmap.
4. Forking in github is making a copy of the whole repository so you can do your own things without messing with the main/original repository.
5. Both Dante and I had issues attending the hackhathan events. For me, either I could not find it or they never went live even though I got an email to check in for the event. The video player for Dante would not load.
