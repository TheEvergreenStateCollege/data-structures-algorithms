Getting things to work on a windows machine is not intuitive. 
Running into atypical errors or sepcial package erros is a bit more confusing.
The hackathon is harder to pay attention to during class time and there was a lot of Hacakthon I wanted to watch so will have to make time later.
Having dedicated time to code in class was not as productive as I would have expected.
I really enjoyed making my portfolio website with github.io
