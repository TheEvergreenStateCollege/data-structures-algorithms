# Co-Creation Week 7
Hey, it'd be really, really cool if you would put assignments on canvas. It's frustrating to have to fish through github to try and find everything. I've been in and out of the hospital all week and didn't know that we had to submit a whole project into that hackathon. Not trying to be an ultra bitch but.. yeah. Thanks. Best wishes.
