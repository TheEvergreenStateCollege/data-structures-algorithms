# Co-Creation Week 7
Hey, it'd be really, really cool if you would put assignments on canvas. It's frustrating to have to fish through github to try and find everything. I've been in and out of the hospital all week and didn't know that we had to submit a whole project into that hackathon. Not trying to be an ultra bitch but.. yeah. Thanks. Best wishes.

We worked on my plans for my final project. These are my plans for my final project. I will have to implement methods for Tree transversal, Filtering words based on user choices using Hangman logic. I am thinking that I will have to create a BST class. It will make the node of the BST represent a word from the dictionary. When the user chooses a letter, traverse the BST to identify words that do not contain the chosen letter. This will keep a list of candidate words (initially containing all words) and narrow down this list as the user makes more letter choices. This continues the game based on the candidate's words until either the user guesses the word or runs out of attempts. My other idea is to investigate binary search for an array rather than putting it into a tree to simplify it. I will probably make a new list every time that the user chooses a letter and avoid the letter.
