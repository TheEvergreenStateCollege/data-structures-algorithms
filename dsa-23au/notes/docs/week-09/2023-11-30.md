# Week 9 - Day 

## Morning Session

### zyBooks Demonstration

As an alternative to submitting homework on GitHub,
you may elect to use an interactive textbook
called zyBooks, which is being offered to us until
the end of the quarter for a discounted price of $57
for each student.

If you have not yet purchased the other textbooks for
the class, or are able to return them, you may
substitute chapters of this book for previous
homework assignments in Canvas.

### Graph Representation (DS) vs. Algorithms

The name of our class is DSA, and we are now
studying graph algorithms, which operate on the graph data structure
to answer questions.

#### Prim's MST Algorithm

For the graph algorithm of Prim's method for finding a
Minimum Spanning Tree, the question is "what subgraph
represents a network that connects all the nodes at
minimum total cost of all the edges?"

A related problem, called finding a *Steiner tree*
where we are allowed to add extra intermediate nodes
to shorten path lengths, can be solved by the
analog computer which is soap film.

The MST for 6 nodes is shown on the left. The other two are common Steiner
trees on the same 6 nodes. The actual Steiner tree that results in real
life from soap films is perhaps the result of physical starting conditions
which are not computable.

As described in this paper

#### Best Graph Data Structure

So far we have considered representing graphs
as a collection of edges (a map, list, or set).



### Minimum Spanning Tree of Cities

Given nodes and edges which are a "complete graph"
between all major U.S. cities, with all pairwise distances
between them, how can we find out which cities are the closest to each
other, and thereby draw a simplified map?
