## Morning Session

### zyBooks Demonstration

As an alternative to submitting homework on GitHub,
you may elect to use an interactive textbook
called zyBooks, which is being offered to us until
the end of the quarter for a discounted price of $57
for each student.

If you have not yet purchased the other textbooks for
the class, or are able to return them, you may
substitute chapters of this book for previous
homework assignments in Canvas.

### Graph Representation (DS) vs. Algorithms

The name of our class is DSA, and we are now
studying graph algorithms, which operate on the graph data structure
to answer questions.

Graph data structures have two main types, based on how they represent edges.

* edges as collections for each node.
* edges as a matrix.

#### Activity 0: Examine Two Graph Representations

You may copy any or all of this code (files, or just snippets)
into your Java projects, or adapt it to your python projects.

https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/tree/main/dsa-23au/java-dsa/graphs

With a partner, examine this code and try to describe what's going on in English.
Compare and contrast the two graph representations, and any other implementations that
you've seen or worked on.

Add your English language description into 

#### Activity 1: Complete Prim's MST Algorithm

For the graph algorithm of Prim's method for finding a
Minimum Spanning Tree, the question is "what subgraph
represents a network that connects all the nodes at
minimum total cost of all the edges?"

A related problem, called finding a *Steiner tree*
where we are allowed to add extra intermediate nodes
to shorten path lengths, can be solved by the
analog computer which is soap film.

The MST for 6 nodes is shown on the left. The other two are common Steiner
trees on the same 6 nodes. The actual Steiner tree that results in real
life from soap films is perhaps the result of physical starting conditions
which are not computable.

As described in this paper
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.1340.pdf

To complete the algorithm, you'll need at least the following steps:

* How to find the minimum edge that cross the visited / unvisited boundary ("the bag")
  * For your first solution, just search through all edges of all visited nodes each time through your while loop.
* How to test if a graph is completely connected (it is possible to reach every node from every other node, if you traverse enough edges).

### Activity 2: Minimum Spanning Tree of Cities

Examine this table of distances between major U.S. cities.
This is also a graph, and one perhaps more naturally thought of
as a matrix of edges than the Delhi train system example

https://www.mapcrow.info/united_states.html

What questions come to mind if you think of the cities as nodes,
and all the distances as weights for edges? Discuss with a partner.

Given nodes and edges which are a "complete graph"
between all major U.S. cities, with all pairwise distances
between them, how can we find out which cities are the closest to each
other, and thereby draw a simplified map?

That is, we wish to "thin out" the complete graph to just cities
that are each other's closest neighbors, and to treat those edges as
special and distinct from an edge which represents the distance between two
cities who are *not* each others nearest neighbors.

### Activity 3: (Optional) Dijkstra's Algorithm

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to take two arguments
(a start and end city) that will find the shortest path
(a collection of edges with minimal weight).
