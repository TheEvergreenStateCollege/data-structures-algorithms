This project is an interface that allows the user to interact with and process a specific dataset. This specific dataset is a csv file containing the amount of messages sent in a discord server on each day, and the day that is being measured. Multiple operations can be performed using the command line, such as setting data to certain values by overwriting the file, inserting new data into the file, or several types of analysis that can be performed on the dataset, such as getting the highest values, finding duplicate values, and most importantly, measuring changes in the message count from day to day and marking the most notable changes.
