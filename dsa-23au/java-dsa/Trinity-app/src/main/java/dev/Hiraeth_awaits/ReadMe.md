# This is my README File for my Final Project Tarot.py:

I did my project in Python because that is the coding Language that I was most comfortable and experienced in. My inspiration came from my decks of Tarot Cards and my passion for using them.
## Part One
In the start of my project I start out by defining all of the Tarot Cards in a list. I had to bring out a Tarot Set of mine to reference while also looking at others to cross reference. I used "Tattoo Tarot" but Megamunden and also your basic Rider-Waite Tarot Deck. I wanted both a new and old interpretation of the cards, to give a better variety to the Readings. I did all 78 Card Meanings one by one in a list. I followed this list by determining how may cards would be drawn for each reading and what they mean or symbolize. 

## Part Two
This is where I started making functions for each type of reading that the User could choose from later on in the program. There are three functions, Three Card Reading, Heart Reading, and Third-Eye Reading. They all only draw three cards, but each reading is for a certain subject. Three card is the classic past, present, future reading. Heart Reading is for matters of Love, and Third-Eye Reading is for matters of Mind. One of my favorite features of each of these is the ability to shuffle the deck. It is a simple and automatic feature but I love it anyway.

## Part Three
After making sure to define the readings, I had to make sure that the interpretations of the readings could be appended correctly. I defined a new function just for this function. I had to make sure it called a card, the name of the card, and finally which position the card was in, while also having it fetch the meaning of the card depending on which card was drawn.

## Part Four
Finally, the most difficult part for me, making sure the user could input in the terminal. I have practiced with inputting on Codecademy, but this took a lot of trial and error to get right. Especially when it came to me making sure to input .lower() to avoid users putting in crazy answers and only allowing all lowercase answers. Within the else statement I made sure to mention that if they have an Invalid Input, they should try putting it in all lowercase. Otherwise, this program works as expected. I wish I could have put in functions for reverse card interpretations, but I was struggling with it and decided to just take it out of the final project for now. Yet, I expect to keep working on it.

P.S. I wanted to attatch my ScreenCapture of the video but it was too large of a file, I will send it via Canvas
