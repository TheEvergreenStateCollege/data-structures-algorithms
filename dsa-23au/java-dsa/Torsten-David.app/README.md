## How we built it

## How to run our demo
We wanted to answer two questions:
1. Which day had the loudest level of sound?
2. What is the Average Step Count per day?

### Sound Level
to answer this question run our program like this 

```
$ cd /workspace/upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/Torsten-David.app
/workspace/upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/Torsten-David.app$ java -jar ./target/Torsten-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar sound-levels
```
The program should output the date(s) of the highest sound level.
The program 
```
The date of the max sound level was:
Date: 11/4/2023, Sound Level : 84.0
```
