# Inspiration

At the beginning of the course, I struggled on trying to find data that would be interesting from a personal level but also from a technical level as well. At first I was very intrigued by the spotify data project that some of my fellow classmates were working on. After many weeks of debate, I decided to generally split from that group and focus on data that would grab my attention. With this in mind, I chose to work on crime data specifically the state of New York. I chose New York in particular becuase of the availabilty and vast quantity of data that the Division of Criminal Justice Services has that is ready to be accessed by the public. The data they have also goes back 20 years so that will allow to perform temporal analysis to see how crime trends have changed over the years that this data has been taken.

#How to run our demo on our included data
Currently, we run our demo with our included data by going into `CrimeDatabase.java` and running the main method. That takes us through our menus to allow to access our data and code in numerous ways. We are storing our crime data in a seperate file so that the database doesnt get overcrowded with information. //FIXMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

# Tech Stack for New York Crime Database

## 1. IDE:
    * GitPod: Most of the development for this project was done mostly on GitPod. It was very helpful and convienient for this class because of its cloud based capabilites. Perosnally for the future programs, If I can utilize the dev pack for github next quarter on VS code, I believe I may switch because of my familiarity and I dont like using browser IDEs. 

## 2 Programming Language/Formats:
    * JavaScript: OOP and dynamic programming for this project (Java 20).
    * CSV: This is the format that I turned my dataset into.
    * Mermaid: Used to set up UML diagram of my project

## 3. Version Control:
    * Git: Use Git for version control, tracking changes in your code.

## 4. Build Automation:
    * Maven: The core tool for managing the build lifecycle, dependencies, and project structure.
    * Dependency Management: 
     Apache Maven Dependency Plugin: Used for managing project dependencies.
     Apache Maven Shade Plugin: Bundles project dependencies into a single, executable JAR file.
    * Testing Frameworks:
     JUnit: A widely used testing framework for Java.
     TestNG: An alternative testing framework with additional features like parallel test execution.

# Challenges that I ran into

The biggest challenge that I ran into with this project was trying to find crime data that reflected trends regarding certain demographics such as age, sex, race, income, education, etc. My initital plan was to use census data to somehow pinpoint those trends. However not a lot of the Census data is split by county and even then that is just bad data usage. It would paint a blurry picutre of these connections if one at all.

Another Challenge that I faced while completing this project was trying have my project read from the csv file. With Pauls Help, i was able to integrate into the `main` method in `CrimeDatabse` the ability to read the csv file. 

# Accomplishments/What I learned

Overall with this final project, it really allowed me to see how important dynamic programming is. I am also very happy with how organized and concise my project is. Last year and beginning of this quarter, I was a very messy programmer. This meant awful spacing, lack of succinct comments, wrong indents, and various syntax errors. This are skills that I have been able to fix by working on this project. I am also proud of my knowledge of the JavaScript langauage and its numerous libriaries. Working on this project as well as lectures throughout the quarter has immensely soldified my skills in java. With `CrimeDatabase`, I have utilized all the skills that I have learned from this quarter whether it is using HashMaps or dictionaries and trying to calculate the runtime of these methods and algorithms. This is more of a note for me but I want to really get into learning Python for these next quarters. A lot of the things that came with coding (Ex: recongnizing when to initialize a new HasMap and recognizing how to connect code with design) has become almost second hand nature to me.
