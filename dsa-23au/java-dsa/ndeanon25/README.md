<h3 align="center">Impossible Hangman</h3>

<p align="center">
    This is Hangman with a twist. It appears to be a simple hangman game but the twist! It is a program where it does not choose a word but rather a list of words/patterns that match your input. Players will have to rely on their deduction skills to guess the word correctly.

<!-- Inspiration  -->

## Inspiration

My inspiration has always been my love for video games. I did not want to over reach and try to create some 3-D video game, I wanted to do a simple puzzle. In my last CS class, we worked on a simple hangman game and I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to make a more complex hangman game. This led me to making a hangman game that basically cheats to make it impossible to win.

### Software Design Diagram

This is my UML
```mermaid
		classDiagram
   ImpossibleHangman <|-- Student
   Person <|-- Professor
   Person : +String name
   Person : +String phoneNumber
   Person : +String emailAddress
   Person: +purchaseParkingPass()
   Address "1" <-- "0..1" Person:lives at
   class Student{
      +int studentNumber
      +int averageMark
      +isEligibleToEnrol()
      +getSeminarsTaken()
    }
    class Professor{
      +int salary
    }
    class Address{
      +String street
      +String city
      +String state
      +int postalCode
      +String country
      -validate()
      +outputAsLabel()  
    }			
```
### Getting Started and Running the Game

1. Go to this Directory
   ```sh
   /workspace/upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/ndeanon25/src/main/java/com/ndeanon25/FinalProjectDSA
   ```
2. Run the file ImpossibleHangman.java with Java Red Hat Extension
   ```sh
   Download = Name: Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
   ```
3. ENJOY THE GAME!!



<!-- How I did I Make it Run -->

## How I did I Make it Run?

Magic. Really, this was a struggle. I made a gameplan and some diagrams of what I wanted.

<li> Read from my dictionary file
<li> Get the input from the player
<li> Use my methods from HangmanLogic ( Behind the scenes)
<li> Start the Hangman game
<li> Lose


<!-- Challenges I ran into-->

## Challenges I ran into

I changed my data structures like 7 times and most of the time I had a surface level understanding of what is I am implementing. StackOverFlow then finally led me to a TreeSet. It is a balanced tree, that uses Set. ChatGPT helped me implement it and figure out what I wanted to do. 

The hardest method for me was the record method. This method will record the user's guess and return a String representation of the word with the guessed char. Based on the guessed char, it will choose the next wordlist and then keep doing that every guess.
