<h3 align="center">Impossible Hangman</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is Hangman with a twist. It appears to be a simple hangman game but the twist is that the program does not choose a word but rather a list of words/patterns that match your input. Players will have to rely on their deduction skills to guess the word correctly.

<!-- Inspiration  -->
## Inspiration

My inspiration has always been video games. I did not want to over reach and try to create some 3-D video game, I wanted to do a simple puzzle. In my last CS class, we worked on a simple hangman game and I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to make a more complex hangman game. This led me to making a hangman game that basically cheats to make it impossible to win.  

### Software Design Diagram

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Getting Started and Running the Game

1. Go to this Directory 
   ```sh
   /workspace/upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/ndeanon25/src/main/java/com/ndeanon25/FinalProjectDSA
   ```
2. Run the file ImpossibleHangman.java with Java Red Hat Extension
   ```sh
   Download = Name: Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat
   ```
3. ENJOY THE GAME!!

<!-- How I did I Make it Run -->
## How I did I Make it Run

Magic. Really, this was a struggle. I made a gameplan and some diagrams of what I wanted. I changed my data structures like 7 times and most of the time I had a surface level understanding of what is I am implementing. StackOverFlow then finally led me to a TreeSet. It is a balanced tree, that uses Set. ChatGPT helped me implement it and figure out what I wanted to do.
