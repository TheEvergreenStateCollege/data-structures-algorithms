# DriverData version 1.2
## DSA-au 2023, Evergreen State College
This program reads the latest csv file generated by @pswish and Nathan @NathanMcl
These CSV files contain specifics about each of our commutes to and from school
The goal of this program was to provide quick summary answers to different driving scenarios
These answers are reflected in the options 1-9 when running the program.

### How to run: 
I have two main methods that perform the same function for compatibility

1. if you use python 3.10, run my program with >>>python3.10 DriverMain.py
2. if you don't have python 3.10, run my program with >>>python3 BackupLogic.py

In either case, follow the on-screen instructions and enjoy!
