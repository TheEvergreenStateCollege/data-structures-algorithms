# Faulkdf's spotify data analysis project.

To run this project, you will want to set your terminal path to be `/workspace/upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/faulkdf-app/DataProject` and run command `python ProjectMenu-Dawson.py` for Dawson's data and `python ProjectMenu-Dante.py` for Dante's.

Once the project is running you will get a dialog box with various options on what to display after data analysis. 

*note* for option 4: Keep in mind it is expecting a two letter country code. Examples:
   
    - US = United States

    - CA = Canada

    - IT = Italy

    - FR = France
