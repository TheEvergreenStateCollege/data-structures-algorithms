Richard's idea:
Flight class (with passenger list, arrival time, departure time)
Airport class (runways, flights)
Think about what methods you would need

Gordon's idea:
The program could track incoming and outgoing flights.
It could track which flight uses which runways (incoming and outgoing).
It could keep track of passenger lists for those flights.

Base on both of your ideas, I managed to create a project that simulates an ATC (Air Traffic Control)
tower terminal computer where they will be able to control entry and exit of a plane into the airport
by runways and parking spaces. More information will be described in my log-book that serves as a 
read-me for this project
