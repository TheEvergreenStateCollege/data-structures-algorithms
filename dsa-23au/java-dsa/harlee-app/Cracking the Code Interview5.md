<u>Cracking the Code Interview 5</u>

I did as many challenges as I could in a span of 2 hours, with small breaks in between, as we have done previously in class. 

Java Data Types Challenge:

Submission:
	https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-datatypes/submissions/code/359741001

Below are the links I used:
- Data types 
	- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html
- java.lang.math
	- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/math-pow-method-in-java-with-example/
- Google search: "Can I use multiple if else java"
	- https://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/51461bd65e90f4eda1007271

Notes:

This one was simple, but annoying. My only errors were misplaced ';', I spelled out integer instead of using 'int' in the system.out.println. As well as a few missing spaces in the print ln. It was correct technically.

Java End of File Challenge:

Submission:
	https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-end-of-file/submissions/code/359743609

Below are the links I used:
- Google search: 'java end of file'
	- https://www.baeldung.com/java-file-detect-end-of-file
- Google search: 'scanner has next'
	- https://www.javatpoint.com/post/java-scanner-hasnext-method
- Google search: 'do while loop java'
	- https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_while_loop.asp

Notes:

This one threw me through a... loop. As I thought at first I needed a for loop. My mind was in the right direction but over thinking it. I did need to keep track of the lines in the scanner, but I made it harder for myself. the do while loop can do this.

Java Static Initializer Challenge

Below are the links I used: 
- Oracle Document:

- ChatGPT Inquiry:

Notes:

I was in the right direction but I failed to realize the use of booleans and what the flag was in the main method. I tried to ask my first question without directly asking for the solution. It did not understand what flag was in this situation, which makes sense. I explained that I think it had to do something with static initializers. This cleared things up for the bot and it instantly gave me the solution. 

I tried to avoid looking directly at the solution and instead of messing with booleans and a if else statement. I was on the right track but I was still getting a lot of errors. I went back to the solution one last time and noticed they {} the entire solution in a static. I do not quite understand why this did it.
