# Week 4 - Day 9
13 October 2023

## Morning Session

Visualizing data structures https://visualgo.net

### Heap Review

* Heaps are based on nodes, like linked lists
* can contain a key and a value
  * key is the priority (like the urgency of a mail package or hospital patient)
  * value is more info to identify the mail package or hospital patient
    * like the contents / description itself (direct) or an ID number (indirect) into another data source
* Balance is key
  * for logarithmic height
  
### Databases and DSA

Databases are like a data structure that allows flexible search,
and some support specialized/ flexible query languages.

* Indexes: speed up queries
* Views: precompiled queries

### General Trees

* Arbitrary children (b-trees) are possible:
  * computer storage directory structure
  * website navigation
  * classification trees for species of living things
  * Dewey decimal library classification system
  * Family ancestries

### Binary Search Trees

A special class of trees depends on nodes having an ordered set for keys.

* Bisection: a more efficient way to search
  * you introduced a bug in software, somewhere in the last 100 commits
  * e.g. egg drop problem
  * depends on sorted data
  * goes to a halfway point, decides whether target is before or after
  * "divide-and-conquer" approach

A tree is like a linked list with up to two (or more) possibilities / forks at each point.
* We focus on binary trees (up to two children at each node)

* BST Invariants
  * left key <= parent key <= right key
  * Balanced invariant

* Game trees (e.g. playing chess, go, turn-based games)
  * a node contains the game state 
* Breadth-first search
* Depth-first search
* How to balance? We'll cover this on Tuesday and Thursday.

## Afternoon Session

### Cracking the Coding Interview

Exercise:
* How to determine what concepts are involved in each problem?
* How to pick a problem that seems to be similar

Attempt problems that use new data structures we've learned:
* heaps
* hash maps
* linked lists
