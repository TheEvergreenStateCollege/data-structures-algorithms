# Co-Creation Week 7

Add up to five sentences about insights or thoughts
that came up during the pair programming exercise, or material from past classes,
or any long-time thoughts you've been holding about programming that you'd like to voice.

Some people find it helpful to see git commands in the context of a real situation in GitPod being typed out.
Monday was Veteran's Day and future DSAs may want to plan an activity for that day that's easy to make up.
One dataset for meteorite crashes from NASA probably has longitude and latitude that can be a 2D feature for nearest neighbor search (which other meteorite crash is closest to my current location on Earth?)
It seems more effective to have a written plan for class that everyone can refer back to.

Paul / Stella Co creation week 7 
Dear Abby:
Paul is a Python wizard an he is very patient. He tried to help me with a weird error in my project, unfortunately the error was too weird. I may have picked up too much "white noise" when collecting my data and it might be causing issues. We'll find a workaround. Pauls project looks great.
Add your responses below please.

Getting things to work on a windows machine is not intuitive. 
Running into atypical errors or sepcial package erros is a bit more confusing.
The hackathon is harder to pay attention to during class time and there was a lot of Hacakthon I wanted to watch so will have to make time later.
Having dedicated time to code in class was not as productive as I would have expected.
I really enjoyed making my portfolio website with github.io

Harlee and Devin
- My program partner helped me come up with some more ideas to implement in my code by asking questions to further understand each others projects. 
- We edited and narrowed down the size of the CSV file Harlee was working with, from 45k+ lines to a little over a 1000. 
- Harlee needed to clean up main and make things more interactive in the terminal. 
- Watching program pair partner work is helpful and sheds light on how other students work. 
- My program partner helped me stay focused on my project, during the time allocated for my code.

We worked on my plans for my final project. These are my plans for my final project. I will have to implement methods for Tree transversal, Filtering words based on user choices using Hangman logic. I am thinking that I will have to create a BST class. It will make the node of the BST represent a word from the dictionary. When the user chooses a letter, traverse the BST to identify words that do not contain the chosen letter. This will keep a list of candidate words (initially containing all words) and narrow down this list as the user makes more letter choices. This continues the game based on the candidate's words until either the user guesses the word or runs out of attempts. My other idea is to investigate binary search for an array rather than putting it into a tree to simplify it. I will probably make a new list every time that the user chooses a letter and avoid the letter. 

We have learned alot about Java language in a short amount of time, In week 7 learning of the in and outs of Java programming , GitHub , GitPod and repositories has brought alot of satisfaction to a once daunting task. Now we are towards the final stretch with our final projects coming up and its important to remind ourselves to take a deep breath because the answer we're looking for may be right under our faces the main goal is to keep learning and have fun coding ! 


Jonathan Rodriguez (Week 7)
This was week was very reassuring but also very challenging at the same time. First Paul helped me understand how pom file plugin and syntax works. Thanks to the resoruces provided by MLH, Paul Swisher and Nathan Maclaughlin, Im going to start my tech blog during break and also learn a little bit of python. Intergrating files within code such as CSV was challenging due to folder issues but once the cuplrit was found, I was able to solve it with ease. Using my past skills from CSF and Intro to C progamming was to create java usage exceptions for the given year and county. This week has been very infromative and helpful from MLH but a lot of the events I was looking forward to were cancelled but im going to check in regularly with future MLH events.

I am realising how difficult java is as a programming language. I have serious considerations on switching languages for my final. I have a little bit of experience in C and Python. Java is just so finicky. 
I am very grateful for my classmates being very patient with me during pair-programming sessions. I am very much struggling at this point in the quarter, but everyone has been very kind and showed me grace. 
Getting the GitHub repo set up on my personal machine with VSCode is an absolute godsend. I don’t need to have gitpod usage anxiety anymore. (I feel like its similar to range anxiety for electric car owners {*what do I know I don’t own an ev*})
Somehow programming languages don’t feel intuitive to learn for me. I am very good at describing (in English) what I want a simple program to do, but I have trouble remembering how to express my feelings in a programming language; java or otherwise. 

Thats all, just a couple complaints.

This week, Juniper and I began to expand the scope of our project and plan out modifications to the codebase to make it better open to new features and modifications. Instead of using data structures (i.e. hashmaps, arrays) as taken from the Java standard library directly in our business code, we've decided to split these structures into their own classes so that we'll be able to modify their representation without needing to make extensive changes to business code as well.

While my Java skills and knowledge have increased using Java in this class, I'm beginning to miss features from other languages. C++ generics feel massively more developed and extensible than generics in Java. Template specialization would have made a certain feature in our project much easier to implement, but because Java doesn't feature template specialization we were forced to use a more OOP solution which was more verbose.
