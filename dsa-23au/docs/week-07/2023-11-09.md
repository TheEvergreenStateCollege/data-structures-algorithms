### Recursive vs. Iterative, and Dynamic Programming Review

This is based upon [this conversation with ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/e4c02f56-658c-4430-ba77-d26c9ea055a7).

The "Coin Change Problem" is to count the number of ways to make a certain amount of cents,
using a set of coin denominations.

Formally, the problem for U.S. cents is:

* Given coins = [1,5,10,25]
* And an `amount` >= 0 in cents
* Return a way to make the `amount` cents with the fewest number of coins.

(The solution could be *degenerate*, which is a mathematical way of saying there could be more than one).

If you've had to work a cash register before the age of swiping cards, Apple Pay, or cryptocurrencies,
you may be able to see that the solution is (probably)

```
{25, 25, 10, 10, 1, 1, 1}
```

according to my human brain, or the 7 coins consisting of

* two quarters
* two dimes
* three pennies

As for what a human brain is actually doing, whether it's dynamic programming or not,
is a question for another time.

Well, hold on. How do we know we can't use a nickel and eliminate those pennies?
If we can't improve our change with one nickel, how about two nickels?
As you can see, there are a dizzying number of combinations to consider if we go about it
in this way, which is a good sign that we've stumbled upon the brute force solution.

We are going to solve this problem in both a *recursive* way
and an *iterative* way, but they are equivalent.

The *iterative* way is often more complicated to express but more efficient,
especially if you are
using a language that doesn't support *tail recursion*, the ability
to call a function and return its value in place of the current function call.

That's because in the *recursive* case, the programming language,
its calling convention, and the call stack (determined by its `Standard Library`)
is doing extra work so that you can express your program in a concise way,
and in the iterative case, you have to do this calling convention work yourself.

#### Mental Preparation: Power Set

To gird up our mental joints, let's consider a form of a brute force solution.
If we want to make the best change possible, we want to consider a set of all combinations
of coins from our denomination, or a set of sets.

One such set of sets which in general is quite large, is called the Power Set.
It is equivalent to *enumerating* the sets in an ordered way,
for example first:

* Including the penny
* Not including the penny

And then

* Including the nickel
* Not including the nickel

Continuing in this way, we see we have two choices for each denomination,
leading to 2^4 = 16 combinations.

In general, for `n` denominations, its power set has `2^n` sets in it.

You can also see this because the choice to include or not include can be
encoded as a bit `0` or `1`, and each set can be encoded as `n`-bit string,
where the `0` means the denomination for that position was *not* chosen,
and `1` means it was.

This is the encoding for choosing 1 penny, 1 nickel, and 1 quarter,
with the penny in the left-most bit, and the quarter in the right-most bit.

```
1101
```

Well, looping over 16 combinations doesn't seem like a big deal,
but you may have noticed that none of these 16 actually adds up to 73 cents
simply because we don't allow repetitions! It doesn't allow for choosing
multiple coins of the same denomination (3 pennies for example).

Well, how about now instead of binary strings, with only `0` and `1`,
we now allow any non-negative number. Here's the encoding of our answer
above, 3 pennies, 2 dimes, 2 quarters.

```
3022
```
To get there, we would now have to search through `4 * 4 * 4 * 4`
possibilities, because each denomination can have `0` chosen.
(If you've been programming as hard as you've been for the past
several weeks, you're used to things being off-by-one and beginning at zero
here in cyberia.)

Searching through 256 choices is also feasible, if we stop when the
amount is greater than 73. Our enumeration might look like:

```
0000
0001
0002
0010
0011
0012
0020
0021
0022
...
```

It's an exercise left to you to design a *canonical* enumeration,
one that is regular enough you could write a program to do it.
You're probably convinced it could be done, and it would take
more steps than enumerating just bit strings.

Well, let's say you are in charge of programming the
change maker in a coin-operated vending machine, or a toll booth.
Or your change-making machine now is selling in a country
with different denominations ([Pre-decimal British coins anyone?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_pound_sterling#Denominations))

Or you're in charge of supplying your company or army and
have to choose between multiple provisions costing different amounts,
taking up different amounts of space, and having different importances.
(This is actually the knapsack problem, which in one version is
solvable with dynamic programming, and in another version, is NP-complete
and among the hardest problems we know how to solve exactly.
If you're curious, try having a conversation with GPT about it.)

You would like to come up with a general solution,
and for more than just 73 cents, and it's possible
you could enumerate each coin to infinity.

It turns out, you might consider a kind of "meta-enumeration",
where you not only choose coins from each denomination,
but you also choose subsets of the denomination.

#### Physical Preparation: 

Open up Gitpod on the main branch to a fresh workspace in the `dynamic-programming`
project.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.png)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/tree/main?folder=/workspace/upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/dynamic-programming)

Open the file `src/main/java/dev/codewithfriends/ChangeMakers.java`

#### Recursive Solution

This is also called a top-down solution because we start with the table entry that we want
and work backwards to a base case, using recursive calls to the inductive case.

As with all recursive approaches, this has a base case and an inductive case.

The final table value is the answer we want:

* Answer = memo[(5, 73)]

Meaning we want to count the number of ways to make change for 73 cents using 5 denominations.
The reason the memo has a two-dimensional index instead of just a one-dimensional index
(the amount of change left to make) so that we can pose the recursive calls for the inductive
case in two ways at each level, which is, to include the last coin, or not to include the last coin.
```
* memo[(5,73)] = memo[(5, 73-25 = 48)] + memo[(4, 73)] // include a quarter or not
```
Each of these calls themselves can be broken up into including the last coin, or not including it.

```
* memo[(5,48)] = memo[(5, 48-25 = 23)] + memo[(4, 48)]
* memo[(4,73)] = memo[(4, 73-10 = 63)] + memo[(3, 73)]
```

This doesn't seem like an improvement so far, but eventually you will get down to
```
* memo[(1,x)] = x // it takes x pennies to make x cents
* memo[(0,x)] = Inf // it would take an infinite amount of no coins to make any amount
```
