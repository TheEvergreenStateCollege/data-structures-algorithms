### Memoization

Often you can build up a solution to a harder problem
from slightly easier / smaller problems.

Over many runs, if you cache these sub-solutions
in the right way, you can speed up your average running time.

### Dynamic Programming Examples

* n-queens Problem
* Knight's Tour

### Profiling and Flame Graphs
