## Morning Session

### Review Fundamentals, and How to Implement Them in Java

* Invariants
* Termination Condition
* Initial state
* ??

Try applying these to the CRUD operations for Lists, first in English, then in Java.

### Analyzing and Comparing Arrays and LinkedList

We will run both `ArrayWrapper` and `LinkedList` on your datasets

## Afternoon Session

### Resource Usage and Efficiency

We focus mainly on two to start with:

Computational (CPU) Time

Computational Space (Memory)

Time-Space Duality

Others:
* Network bandwidth

### Asymptotic Analysis

Algorithm analysis, pioneered by Donald Knuth, in The Art of Computer Programming.

How these resource usages grow with input size.

Hierarchy from most efficient to least efficient 

* Constant
* Logarithmic
* Polynomial
  * Linear
  * Quadratic
  * Cubic
  * ...
* Quasi-polynomial or Sub-Exponential
* Exponential
