# Co-Creation Week 2

Add your sentences below here.
Some notes about Reading Wk 2(Hiraeth):

1)It is okay and normal to stutter during an interview.
2)Any Hash Map can have a collision, and there are many ways of solving it.
3)Listening is the first step to solving a problem.
4)Data structures can either be linked or continuous.
5)The dictionary data type gives access to data items.

Cracking the Coding Interview (McDowell)
•	I think, for me personally I’m somewhere in the middle of page 31. The market right now looks really bleak and it seems like you need to be related to someone already working at the company to actually get noticed.
•	Fundamental data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, serve as the backbone for numerous algorithms and operations.
•	Understanding hash table collisions, wherein multiple keys map to the same index, is pivotal for optimizing hash table performance.
The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena, 3rd edition)
•	Contiguous arrays, while providing O(1) access, have limitations when resizing.
•	Linked lists cater to dynamic data storage requirements, offering efficient insertions and deletions at the expense of O(n) random access.
•	Stacks, with their LIFO nature, and queues, with their FIFO characteristic, are quintessential data structures for specific problem-solving paradigms.
•	Hash maps or dictionaries facilitate rapid key-value look-ups, with efficiency hinging on a robust hash function and effective collision handling.

    Notes from Week 2
1) C.R.U.D means to create, read/search, update, delete/remove
2) Stacks are last in and first out while Queues are first in and first out.
3) The weaknesses of arrays are the slow insertion, fixed size, and inefficient memory allocation. While the linked list has fast insertion, dynamic sizing, and efficient memory allocation. The downside to linked lists is that they have a slow search time.
4) The reason we should code review is that it transfers knowledge from one person to another, and it helps to see someone's process to incorporate it into your own process.
5) I am still getting the hang of the GitPod so the steps are to make a new branch, write/modify code, commit, push a request, get a code review, and then delete the branch once reviewed and merged.
   ==================================================================

1. Take note of all the interview questions if you have many steps of the flowchart to interview day already complete.
2. Some interesting info on how to tackle a problem and how to solve it with an algorithm. Looks like a guide on how to practice the much dreaded code whiteboard interview, which I have never done.
3. I spent a few hours searching about stack overflow issues a few days ago. Page 91 provides all the information I needed in a non-comment format. Just the facts.
4. Much of the reading is heavy in the weeds and worth a re-read or three.
5. A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. An array provides constant read access to an index where a linked list does not which I found like a key tidbit to determine the difference

Looking back through my notes. Ah what fun!

1. CRUD was a very important idea this week. I like how its a simply acronym to remember, while also having a funny name
2. Being proactive seems to be important in the job market. Especially the programmer job market. 
2. I like how many of the basic data strucures have a name that visually describes them A stack is like a *stack* of playing cards. An organised pile. Queues are like a reverse stack, and fucntion, well... like a queue. Heaps are a pile etc etc. 
4. the flowchart in Cracking the Coding Interview was fun. I like explanations that include a visual aid. 
5. Specifically, the point on the map "Be confident (not cocky)" is such an important point. lots of people may have extraordinary skills, but if they are fundamentally difficult to be around, they arent usefull in a team setting.
6. 

Lucretian: 

-CRUD = create, read, update, delete
-Using gitpod was still causing me lots of trouble.
-Hash maps can have collisions, but there are ways to deal with it. 
-Listening is the first step in solving problems, and data structures can be linked or continuous, each with its own pros and cons. 
-The dictionary data type is there for quick access to data items, and it's essential to know about different data structures for coding interviews .

1. I this week was a very important week for me I learned a lot about Hash Mabs and a raise while in class I was still trying to figure out just the process of how to do the homework
2. There's a lot of things on my mind all week to you about the class is a Coke creation and I'm not sure if the part that I'm doing in class actually contributed
3. What I can understand the link this is pretty much a list that is categorized and sorted through by the algorithm and keep track of by every cell in a consecutive order
4. At this point I do remember feeling overwhelmed and that I've put myself into too much of a task and so I looked into dropping out of this course
5. Overall I'm very grateful I did not come out of the course I ended up going to the library and getting the big red book and doing YouTube's of what Java code was all about
