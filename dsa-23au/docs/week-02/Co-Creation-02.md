# Co-Creation Week 2

Add your sentences below here.
Some notes about Reading Wk 2(Hiraeth):

1)It is okay and normal to stutter during an interview.
2)Any Hash Map can have a collision, and there are many ways of solving it.
3)Listening is the first step to solving a problem.
4)Data structures can either be linked or continuous.
5)The dictionary data type gives access to data items.

Cracking the Coding Interview (McDowell)
•	I think, for me personally I’m somewhere in the middle of page 31. The market right now looks really bleak and it seems like you need to be related to someone already working at the company to actually get noticed.
•	Fundamental data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, serve as the backbone for numerous algorithms and operations.
•	Understanding hash table collisions, wherein multiple keys map to the same index, is pivotal for optimizing hash table performance.
The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena, 3rd edition)
•	Contiguous arrays, while providing O(1) access, have limitations when resizing.
•	Linked lists cater to dynamic data storage requirements, offering efficient insertions and deletions at the expense of O(n) random access.
•	Stacks, with their LIFO nature, and queues, with their FIFO characteristic, are quintessential data structures for specific problem-solving paradigms.
•	Hash maps or dictionaries facilitate rapid key-value look-ups, with efficiency hinging on a robust hash function and effective collision handling.

    Notes from Week 2
1) C.R.U.D means to create, read/search, update, delete/remove
2) Stacks are last in and first out while Queues are first in and first out.
3) The weaknesses of arrays are the slow insertion, fixed size, and inefficient memory allocation. While the linked list has fast insertion, dynamic sizing, and efficient memory allocation. The downside to linked lists is that they have a slow search time.
4) The reason we should code review is that it transfers knowledge from one person to another, and it helps to see someone's process to incorporate it into your own process.
5) I am still getting the hang of the GitPod so the steps are to make a new branch, write/modify code, commit, push a request, get a code review, and then delete the branch once reviewed and merged.
