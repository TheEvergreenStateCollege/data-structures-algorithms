## Java Resources

A Java refresher course

The official Java Development Kit Reference and API Documentation

## CRUD: Guidelines for Data Type Interfaces

Every data structure that we study will have most or all of these methods in some form.
These are also the basic operations in databases.

Create: (sometimes also insert, or insertAt with an index)
Read: (somtimes called *search* or *find* or *getAt* with an index)
Update: (sometimes called *updateAt* with an index)
Delete: (sometimes called *remove*, or *extract*)

These will be useful later when we steady Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
and the REST paradigm (Representational State Transfer)

Other useful methods:

Min
Max

## array-links and Unit Tests

Work together in pairs.

Complete all the methods of `List` interface in ArrayWrapper, except for `iterator`.

Learn about `Nodes` and links, complete all the methods of `List` interface for `LinkedList`, except for `iterator`

Spin up GitPod workspace from scratch and test Maven compilation.

There is currently no linting, autocomplete, or autosuggest in our instance of VSCode,
so you will have to learn more about Java and be your own linter for now.

Use the following rule of thumb:

* Read through your code line-by-line. If you and your teammates believe it has an 80% chance of compiling successfully, you can compile it with `mvn package`
* Otherwise, continue looking through online documentation, reading your book, or asking AI chats to modify your code and build confidence.

## Hacktoberfest

A good way to learn about open source, hacker culture, using version control like GitHub with
pull requests, and communicating with other programmers. We'll be participating as a class
during the month of October to reinforce the skills we are already learning, with also the chance
to win some prizes and have trees planted in the world.

You can optionally substitute work on your four pull requests for any of the weekly Java programming
assignments during October.

You can choose an open source project in the language you are learning (Java for most students) that you
are already a user of, or that you find interesting and would like to try.

(You can search through the algorithms already implemented, and find a new one in one of your textbooks
that you can add to the shared online collection.)
