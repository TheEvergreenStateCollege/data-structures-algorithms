On Tuesday, we discussed fundamental algorithm principle.
'Algorithms take state where invariant is true, then outputs invariant as true.'
On Thursday, we uploaded a dataset to upper-division-cs/dsa-23au/java-dsa/arrays-link/src/main/GhostTowns.CSV
Need to push/pull gitpod.
We discussed possible project ideas.what are we going to learn as a team
-- faulkdf-dawsonwhi --
Paul is cryptogoth.

we need more practice with git and gitpod and github.

SSH keys are confusing and I just want to use my VS code not GitPods'.

we are lost but so is everyone else so its okay.

I still don't know what to make a list of.

We learned that data structures are found commonly in everday life.

They are used to organize data.

Everyone has their own way of setting things up.

Algorithms are processes that take an input state and put out an output state.

I'm excited for this quarter. I personally haven't applied anything from CML to DSA.
Being incentivized by credits to talk to the nearest person is something? Either way,
I am happy to be here. Thank you.

They will always have an invariant, which is a known stating state.
1. For the first week, I have and still am learning how to navigate github and gitpod.-Torsten
2. Familiarization with GIT is helpful for the first two days of class to reduce the confusion one experiences.
3. Working with other people helps solve issues better versus working alone, Especially for new people. It is much more fun to code with others, solo is made for sleepless nights.
4. A refresher online course before class on Java would be beneficial.
5. Collaboration is much more rewarding in person than remotely.
what are we going to learn as a team

Change makers lab is from 1pm -5pm 
Is this classs monday as well? Yes this class is Mnday Tuesday Thursday
Taking this Course has already Changed my life !
I was choosing to work a job from 8am- 4pm runing netwrok data abling for $26 an hour but chose this class instead I am very very greatful

Readjusting work to fit around this class was wise.
Learning how to work Gitpod/Github is hard.
I need to get blue light glasses to protect my eyes.
Bringing water is a great idea so I can focus.
I consume caffeine in order to stay awake, but it would be better to drink Matcha than Coffee.

I took the Changemaker Lab in Fall 2022 and I learned lots of leaderships skills and workshopping skills. I love Destiny 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog. I cant wait to buy my new GPU so I can do more in programming and designs/modeling. I am excited to graduate this year with BS and get my cybersecurity. I am also excited to further my skills at game development.

////FOR OCT 5 assignment This past week, I had to brush up on my programming and psuedocode skills that we learned in CSF. I have grown pretty comfortable with arrays and linked lists. My syntax skills have gotten better as I have been using Java API (I urge you to use that as a tool). I have also been practicing call function because that is a great skill to learn with arrays and linked lists. Also ALWAYS PUT COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE!!!

we need more practice with git and gitpod and github.

SSH keys are confusing and I just want to use my VS code not GitPods'.

we are lost but so is everyone else so its okay.

I still don't know what to make a list of.

Sometimes there is confusion, and teammates having a different viewpoint corrects for missing information in conversation.


/// faulkdf \\\
This class so far is *incredbly* chaotic. I don't belive that I have ever taken a class here at Evergreen that is this level of "all over the place."
Code, and coding has never been my strong suit, but having to do a fair amount of it has been a good refresher. \
Many times, I really feel as if I am totall lost in class, however I'm pretty sure that theres a fair amount of us that feel the same. 
Skills are improving on how to do everthing in a co-created repository, I still worry that I am often doing something wrong.

Learning to use Github is confusing, will take time and effort to learn.
Caffiene is my best friend.
There will usually be an invarient of some kind.
Nobody knows what we are doing, but it can be fun to pair with others to learn.
Being lost is oddly helping me learn more, if that makes sense.

For those who would like to know, a hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. I like to split hash code into a 3 step process (Compute, Map, Avoid Collisions). There are many ways to deal hash code collisions such as linked lists, search trees, and linear probing. A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science. Think of it as a stack of plates where you can only remove or add plates to the top of the stack.

 This week was very challenging for me regarding search trees. But the more and more that we practiced in class I do feel my grasp on them has gotten better. For my first project with Dante and Dawson I was thiniking implementing of the data structure that we used in class into our spotify data that we are collecting. As an update, we have to wait less than a month to recieve our spotify data. In the meantime, I can create designs for what our goals would be. An example can be making a class that checks our most listened to artist or song.


Jonathan Week 6
This past week in DSA has been super helpful for me in developing and sharpening my skills. From our time in Gitpod working on the sorting algorithms, I am starting to become accustomed to debugging, especially using certain extensions. My attention to detail such as concise and legible syntax has shined from this week compared to how I started in CSF and a few weeks into the course. Iâ€™ve also made a good habit of commenting on my code so that my peer-programmers can get some assistance on what to make of my code. I have also gotten much better at git commands with wanting to learn more in the future like unix and PowerShell. Version Control is something that I have become accustomed to now that we're pretty deep in the quarter (I am able to navigate through Github without bashing my head against the wall). I also believe my problem solving skills regarding code is more refined with understanding how methods are implemented and how they access or manipulate data in whatever project we are working on.

Notes from Week 3 
- We learned the Orders of Growth, Big O notation, and how we want our code to get to O(1) for the most efficient time.  
- There is no clear answer on what the best data structure there is, it really just depends on what you need. Every data structure is useful in its own way.  
- A problem-solving flowchart is really useful and helps break down problems into smaller actions that you are able to work on. Listen to all the information, find an example, brute force, so find a solution ASAP and it does not matter if it is efficient. Solve manually on an example and try to reverse engineer it. Optimize, so look at B.U.D (any bottlenecks, unnecessary or duplicated work) to take out of your code. 
- Singly linked lists are when each node points to the next node while doubly linked list is when each node points to both the next node and the previous node. 
- Array list is used for dynamic sizing an array while providing O(1) access, so when an array is full, it doubles and takes O(n) but that does not happen a lot so it should still be efficient when running.

Notes from Week 4 
- In-order transversal visits the nodes in ascending order. Pre-order transversal is when the root is always the first node visited. Post-order Transversal is when the root is the last node visited.  
- A Trie is a variant of an n-ary tree in which characters are stored at each node, while a graph is a collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them.  
- The two most common ways to search a graph are depth-first search and breath-first search. DFS starts at the root and explores each branch completely before moving on to the next branch. BFS starts at the root and explores each neighbor before going on to any of their children.  
- DFS is often used if we want to visit every node in the graph while BFS is used to find the shortest path between two nodes.  
- For adding runtimes, these are separated for loops. So, it is supposed to do this first loop and then when it is done with that, it does the second loop next. For multiplying the runtimes, it does the first loop and for each object it is iterating through, it must do another for loop. So, it is basically a do this, for each time you do that.     

======================

Notes from Week 6 
- I worked on Codeacademy and was brushing up on my Java syntax, there are a few lessons on recursion that are helpful. They use a great example of when you are in a line, and you do not know how many people are in front of you. You do the inductive case and ask the person in front of you how many people are in front of you. Then, that person asks, and so on until you reach your base case, there is only one person in front of you, so it goes back, and the person says one person in front of me, then it goes back and says two people are in front of me. CodeAcademy is helpful with their lessons.  
- My final project is going okay, while I do have some methods and algorithms, I want to use for my lottery picks, it is difficult to start coding and just start from scratch. I have a couple of UMLs I created but besides that, it has been difficult to start it. 
- I am also looking more into Binary Search Tree since my hangman project would use a BST to avoid the letter the player is choosing.  
- Visualgo is helpful with showing us the sorts and how it works. I enjoy the pseudocode and the diagrams that are easy to follow and see. At first, I did not understand merge sort but just following the diagram and seeing the code run in real-time helped me understand it. 
- Also, the presentations that the ILC students were working on were interesting. Quinn with the web scraping RedFin using Selenium and Aspen taught us about XSS cross-site scripting attacks. They were all really fascinating.

Juniper - Lucretian
-Week 1 perplexed me with the idea of a clearly different way of going about the subject than I was expecting.
-I was excited about the idea of a fundamental principle of data structures and algorithms.
-I immediately realized that not coding for the whole summer did not do me any favors.
-I was excited about the idea of pairprogramming and working with others over shared code while still doing independent development. 
-Learning gitpod was extremely clumsy.
