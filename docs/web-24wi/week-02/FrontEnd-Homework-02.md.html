<p>Complete the Pet Photo Carousel project in your assignments directory, first creating this directory if necessary.  </p>
<pre><code>cd &lt;repo_dir&gt;/web-24wi/assignments/&lt;github_username&gt;/frontend/week2

This is also a place where teaching staff and classmates can give you help and feedback.  </p>
<pre><code>git add .  
git commit -m "&lt;describe your change&gt;"  
git push -u origin &lt;github_username&gt;-week2  
</code></pre>
<h3 id="preparationforcodeinterview">Preparation for Code Interview</h3>
<p>You will receive your feedback and evaluation for this assignment next week by Canvas and a 1:1 in-person in-person code interview with teaching staff. Don't worry, do your best.</p>
<p>You can practice a mock interview with your classmates by following this script (as the interview)  </p>
<ul>
<li>Interviewer: Tell me about your code<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; * Interviewee: (if you don't know where to start, divide your code up into 4-5 sections, and describe their purpose in order)  </li>
<li>Interviewer: (removes three random lines of code without showing interviewee)<ul>
<li>Interviewers will give hints and narrow down the range of where the change happened.</li>
<li>Interviewee: (given time to re-run the code, understand what has happened, add it back, explain the purpose of that line, and how they came to that conclusion)</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>At any time, it is okay for the interviewee to say "I'm stuck, but here is what I am thinking. Can I have a hint?"</p>
