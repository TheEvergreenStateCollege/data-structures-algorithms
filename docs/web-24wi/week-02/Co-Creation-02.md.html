<h4 id="prepareyourresponse">Prepare Your Response</h4>
<p>There are two parts to your submission and one task after that</p>
<ul>
<li>A) Three examples of data visualizations that you choose from the reading<ul>
<li>for each example:<ul>
<li>what is compelling, useful, or interesting about it to you?</li>
<li>what is a website (give the URL) that demonstrates this type of data visualization?</li>
<li>say a sentence or two about the website you chose</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>B) Three web interactions that you remember, adapt, or develop <em>offline</em> (do not do this with a computer yet)<ul>
<li>for each example:<ul>
<li>what about the interaction is compelling, useful, or interesting to you?</li>
<li>(now with a computer and your usual search tools, do this part <em>online</em>) what is a website (give the URL) that demonstrates the kind of web interaction that you imagined offline?</li>
<li>say a sentence or two about the website you choose</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>C) Review a pull request that one of your classmates sends you about their co-creation. Read through their co-creation and try to go to all their suggested website URLs. Write a response as a pull request comment.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details for each of these prompts appear below. Take your time, and develop each of your examples. Don't be afraid to sleep on it, revise, start from scratch, and discuss with classmates. The Web Infra homework is light for week 2 to give you time for co-creation. Here is a guide to balance your time between the assignments, for 12 hours of homework total for the Web Engineering tracks.</p>
<ul>
<li>6 hours: Web Front End HW 2</li>
<li>3 hours: Web Infra HW 2</li>
<li>3 hours: Co-Creation HW 2<ul>
<li>you may wish to time yourself on active thinking</li>
<li>at around 2h, transitioning from ideating / browsing will given you 1h to write and fully develop your idea for submission.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="athreeexamplesofdatavisualizationandanaxis">A) Three Examples of Data Visualization, and an Axis</h3>
<p>(You may read through the co-creations already in the Markdown file from your classmates so far.)</p>
<p>Pick two types of data visualizations from the reading that you find the most effective or interesting. Try to pick different ones than have already been chosen by your classmates. If you'd like to keep developing your dataset from Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Fall Quarter, pick data visualizations that you think are well-suited to that project, and answering questions from that dataset.</p>
<p>Look on the web, or ask your friends, for modern websites that are examples of those data visualizations.</p>
<pre><code class="mermaid language-mermaid">flowchart LR
  Products/Posts &lt;---&gt; ???
</code></pre>
<p>Consider traditional product and social media websites as one end of a spectrum. These often display one post / one product as a rectangular card in a grid, that you can click on to view more details. What would be the other end of this spectrum? What would you call it and why? (There is no single "correct" answer). One end of the spectrum is not inherently "better" than the other. Also, there may be more than one axis; a multi-dimensional space of web interactions. If this appeals to you, say more about what the dimensions could be.</p>
<p>Include a description of your chosen axis with your co-creation sentences.</p>
<p>Then pick a third type of a data visualization that is suggested by, or is an extension, of one or more examples in the Tufte reading. It should be a kind of visualization that does not directly appear in the reading, and exists on the axis you just created. It can be close to the first two examples, or at any distance removed from them, on this axis.</p>
<p>As a fictitious example, let's say you picked from Tufte's reading "bar graph" and "pie chart". You find two websites "abc.com" and "def.info" that show interesting uses of bar graphs and pie charts. You might think the other end of the axis from product / social media is "food memes", and you might think a third example suggested by these two is some kind of spiral diagram. What might that look like, and what data might be well-suited to it? You might find a website "ghi.net" that shows a spiral diagram of a cinnamon bun, with the radial axis corresponding to how many pastries are consumed by Americans at different times of day, the angular axis. Is that far or close to the product / social media end of the spectrum, along the food meme axis? </p>
<p>Don't worry if you don't have all the details, your ideas are still vague or in-development, or it doesn't make perfect sense. Consider aesthetic and other considerations as well as analytical ones, as well as what is fun for you to think about.</p>
<p>Add your response to the markdown file above. Remember, for Part A) your response will look like three paragraphs, each one following this form:</p>
<ul>
<li>an example of a data visualization from the Tufte reading, with page number you found it on,</li>
<li>a website URL that you find online that resembles the data visualization,</li>
<li>remarks about that website with respect to the Tufte reading</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bthreeexamplesofwebinteractions">B) Three Examples of Web Interactions</h3>
<p>(You may read through the co-creations already in the Markdown file from your classmates so far.)</p>
<p>Not all websites and web interactions are meant to convey a dataset. Some are purely aesthetic, entertainment, or something else entirely.</p>
<p>Think of three examples of interactions that you'd like to see on a website. It could be a website you've seen in the past, one that you dreamed about, or one that you are developing fresh for this assignment.</p>
<p>Write a few sentences in English about each example.</p>
<p>As in the previous example, then go search on the web, post in online forums or social media, or ask your friends in person, if they have heard of or seen websites similar to some aspects of what you've described.</p>
<p>Add your response to the markdown file above. Remember, </p>
<h3 id="creviewanypullrequestsassignedtoyou">C) Review any Pull Requests Assigned to You</h3>
<p>Check your GitHub inbox (in the top-right corner of the website github.com when you're logged in). A blue dot will mean you have new notifications, possibly of pull requests assigned to you. Click it to view.</p>
<p>This may take throughout the week for your classmates to finish their work and request your review. </p>
<h2 id="whattosubmitandreview">What To Submit and Review</h2>
<p>In total, you will submit, as edits to the Markdown file:</p>
<p>For Part A) 3 paragraphs following this form</p>
<ul>
<li>an example of a data visualization from the Tufte reading, with page number you found it on,</li>
<li>a website URL that you find online that resembles the data visualization,</li>
<li>remarks about that website with respect to the Tufte reading</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, for Part B) 3 paragraphs following this form:</p>
<ul>
<li>an example of a web interaction that occurs to you while offline</li>
<li>a website URL that you find online,</li>
<li>remarks about that website with respect to the web interaction that you imagined</li>
</ul>
<p>and create a Pull Request to add these 6 paragraphs to the monorepo.</p>
<p>Finally for Part C) you will assign this pull request to a classmate as a reviewer, to request a review.</p>
<p>Submit all your writing <a href="https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/blob/main/web-24wi/docs/week-02/Co-Creation-02.md">in this one single Markdown file on the GitHub website</a>
To edit it from the website, click on the pencil icon in the upper-right corner. When it comes time to commit your changes, choose "Propose changes on a new branch" and then create a pull request with your changes. Request as a Reviewer one of your classmates. You can ask them in-person, or in Discord as well, if it's okay to request a review from them.</p>
