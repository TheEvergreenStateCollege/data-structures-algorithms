<h1 id="webinfrastructurehomework01">Web Infrastructure - Homework 01</h1>
<p>To get us warmed up and ready for our first code interview, our first week's homework will be reviewing key skills. Those of you who took Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) last quarter will recognize most of these. If you weren't in DSA last quarter, don't worry. We'll be introducing these skills gradually this quarter.</p>
<p>By Week 3 we will be regularly using <code>git</code> to submit the rest of the homeworks in this class.</p>
<h2 id="lap1cloudandbackendsetup">Lap 1: Cloud and Backend - Setup</h2>
<p>Lap 1 is for students taking Web Infrastructure for the first time. Since this is the first time this class is being taught, everyone will do this part. Each Lap is meant to take 6 hours of homework and preparation time each week outside of class time.</p>

### Git Review

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 67f423f (Updated Web Engineering syllabus.)

## Lap 2: Rust

### Setup

If you were in DSA last quarter, you can use a *new* GitPod workspace from the monorepo. It now includes a sparkling âœ¨ new Rust build system.

Alternatives to have a Rust development environment:
* you will need to complete the AWS setup first in order to have an environment in order to develop Rust.
* you can read the [Rust Book Chapter 01] and install Rust tools on your personal machine
