<h2 id="webinspector">Web Inspector</h2>
<p>The Web Inspector is a modern set of tools included in most major web browsers that is indispensable in understanding existing websites, as well as making your own websites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements / Inspector<ul>
<li>The DOM (Document Object Model)</li></ul></li>
<li>Console<ul>
<li>The Console is like a command-line interface for a website.</li>
<li>It's an interactive REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) that you can use to try out and learn through "programmatic" access to a website's state and structure.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="codepen">Code Pen</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>CodePen is a website that gives you an online editor for HTML, CSS, Javascript with a live preview</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the website https://pen.new</p></li>
<li><p>In pairs, have the navigator dictate the index.html page to the driver in the HTML pane
https://github.com/learner-long-life/learning-and-teaching/blob/master/small-demos/16-Static-Page/index.html</p></li>
<li><p>Switch driver and navigator, then dictate the styles.css into the CSS pane</p></li>
