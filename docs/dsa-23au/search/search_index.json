Some students in the program have already studied data structures (DS &amp; A). Those students will be creating their own curriculum in groups. For students who want to learn DS &amp; A, the program syllabus will look like this:         </p> <p> <ul> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms;</li> <li>Team programming projects (with ChangeMakers)</li> <li>Synthesis of real-world problems with software modeling</li> <li>Software Engineering</li> </ul> </p> <p>         As computer science students, you will deepen your technical knowledge and skills required to understand, analyze, modify, and build complex software systems. The concepts and skills from Data Structures and Algorithms are key for software engineering and programming. Through this program you will also deepen your understanding of computing systems, both in theory and practice. The work will provide prerequisite knowledge for Evergreen's advanced computer science programs.\u00a0         </p> <p>         Working on team projects is very important for almost any job, especially in computer science. Also, at Evergreen we expect students to take charge of their learning. We make this easier by providing\u00a0 a caring and safe innovative team environment. This is ideal for those looking for a practical, hands-on approach to learning. This radically different pathway gives students the opportunity to set-up and run their own projects and ventures. Inspired by the pioneering Finnish \u2018Tiimiakatemia\u2019 approach, we designed this program collaboratively with the ChangeMaker Lab, which was the first to introduce this approach in the United States. The Tiimiakatemia ChangeMaker Lab is accredited by Tiimiakatemia Global\u00ae.         </p> <p>         In the first few weeks you will form a Team Company of up to 20 students, and work on real projects and research the programming, software engineering, and theoretical\u00a0 skills needed for those projects. You will gain entrepreneurial experience and learn how to operate and run an organization as a Holacratic structure. As a Team Entrepreneur, you\u2019ll work with your team in your own office environment virtually or in the classroom in our innovative open office space.\u00a0 You will create and manage projects around your passions, attend directors' meetings. You will have the opportunity to learn the auxiliary skills to manage budgets and build valuable contacts and networks.\u00a0         </p> <p>         You will learn by doing and specifically develop the following job skills: Self\u2010leadership skills, Project leading skills, Planning skills, Team Coaching skills, Strategic skills, Team leadership skills, Service, negotiation and selling skills, Understanding of financial issues, Marketing skills, Innovation skills, Team leadership skills, Data processing and IT \u2013skills, Team Learning skills, Creativity skills, International skills and Communication skills and work on developing Initiative, Courage to make choices and goal orientation.         </p> <p>         This full-time daytime program will be taught on the Olympia campus. Students who need to participate fully remotely should contact the faculty to discuss that option.         </p> <p>         Computer technology has an impact on almost anything we do, and data structures and algorithms are central to advanced study in computer science and to building large complex systems. When applying for positions such as Software Developer or Software Engineer, you will probably find that this program is the most important in helping you prepare for job interviews. In this program, you\u2019ll learn about ways to organize data (we\u2019ll see various data structures such as Lists, Trees, Graphs), ways to compare algorithms (we\u2019ll focus on space and time complexity using big Oh) and efficiently solve programming problems. It will also give you a chance to practice object-oriented and functional programming.         </p> <p>         We are so excited to work with all of you in this awesome program.         </p> <p>         We expect everyone to attend in person, unless you contact us to make alternative arrangements.         </p> Class Meeting Times <p>Monday</p> <p>Tuesday</p> <p>Wednesday</p> <p>Thursday</p> <p>Friday</p> 10am-1pm <p>Data Structures</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p>Systems and Teams</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Data Structures</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 12noon-1pm <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Forest Walk</p> <p></p> <p>&amp;nbps;</p> <p></p> <p>break</p> <p></p> <p>tutoring</p> <p></p> 1-3pm <p>Cracking the Coding Interview / Software Engineering</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3-5pm <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Textbooks:</p> <p>Required</p> <ul> <li>The Algorithm Design Manual, 3rd edition, by Steven Skiena ()</li> <li>Cracking the Coding Interview \u2013 189 programming questions and solutions, Gayle Laakmann McDowell, 6th edition (CCI)ISBN-13: 978-0984782857 </li> </ul> <p>Optional</p> <ul> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 3rd or 4th edition, by Mark Allen Weiss</li> <li>Dive into Systems (DIS)\u00a0 Dive Into Systems Text: https://diveintosystems.org/development/antora/diveintosystems/1.0/index.html</li> <li>Parallel computing for Beginners https://www.learnpdc.org/PDCBeginners2e/</li> </ul> Concrete Examples Synthesis / Lateral Thinking Week 1 <p>A Self-Guided Tour</p> <p>RAM Model, Lists</p> <p>Arrays, Links, Counters</p> <p>Interfaces, CRUD Operations</p> <p>IntelliJ and Git: practice and warmup</p> <p>Pair Programming: what roles? what rules?</p> <p>Learning Log, ChatGPT / AI prompting</p> <p>ChangeMaker teams, learning together</p> Week 2 <p>Implementation vs. Interfaces</p> <p>Stacks, Queues</p> <p>Key-Value Maps, Hashing</p> <p>Collisions, Links</p> <p>Time-Space and Other Dualities, Resources</p> <p>How to trade off time for space, vice versa?</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Counting and visualizing resources: VisualVM</p> Week 3 <p>Asymptotic Analysis (Big O)</p> <p>Trees, Relations, Searching</p> <p>Traversals: Bread-first, Depth-First</p> <p>Heaps (Priority Queues)</p> <p>Recursion and Iteration</p> <p>Cleaning Up: Invariants, Rebalancing</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Overview of Final Project: Problem-Finding</p> Week 4 <p>Rebalancing Trees</p> <p>Red-Black Trees</p> <p>Rebalancing Heaps</p> <p>Inventing New Data Structures</p> <p>An Exotic Zoo: Fibonacci Forest, Skip Lists</p> <p>Amortized Analysis</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Final Project Work: Collecting / Mocking Datasets</p> Week 5 <p>Maximum Subset Sum</p> <p>Dynamic Programming</p> <p>Interval Scheduling</p> <p>Satisficing (Greedy)</p> <p>Subproblems</p> <p>Memoizing / Caching</p> <p>Combining two or more algorithms</p> <p>Final Project Work: Collecting Datasets</p> Week 6 <p>Graphs</p> <p>Topological Sort, Dependencies</p> <p>Shortest Path (Dijkstra's)</p> <p>Network Flow</p> <p>MapQuest / Google Maps</p> <p>Find algorithms in the news</p> <p>Final Project Work: Designing Operations</p> <p>AI proompting and co-pilot: write code</p> Week 7 <p>Sorting, with Heaps and Trees</p> <p>Merge Sort</p> <p>Quicksort</p> <p>Radix Sort</p> <p>Randomized analysis</p> <p>Combining two sorts</p> <p>Joke Sorts: delay as much as possible</p> <p>Art: Pixel sorting</p> Week 8 <p>Database Indexes, Search</p> <p>Page Rank</p> <p>Linear Systems of Equations</p> <p>Constraint Satisfaction</p> <p>Boggle / Scrabble</p> <p>Final Project Work: Analysis and Correctness</p> <p>Find linear systems / constraints in real-life</p> <p>Connect DS &amp; A to another discipline</p> Week 9 <p>Karatsuba / Matrix Multiplication</p> <p>Divide and Conquer</p> <p>Streaming Algorithms</p> <p>Parallel Merge Sort</p> <p>Data Privacy</p> <p>Find algorithms in the news</p> <p>Parallelize a previous algorithm</p> <p>Final Project Work: Analysis and Correctness</p> Week 10 <p>Bonus Topics / Catchup Week</p> <p>Quantum DS &amp; A</p> <p>Recommender Systems</p> <p>Collaborative Filtering</p> <p>Finding Real World Examples: Go Local, Go Deep</p> <p>Final Project Work</p> <p>Synthesizing notes\u00a0</p> Tracks <p> Student who have never taken DSA before will take DSA in this quarter and participate in Changemakers team companies.

For the first week, I have and still am learning how to navigate github and gitpod.-Torsten 2. Familiarization with GIT is helpful for the first two days of class to reduce the confusion one experiences. 3. Working with other people helps solve issues better versus working alone, Especially for new people. It is much more fun to code with others, solo is made for sleepless nights. 4. A refresher online course before class on Java would be beneficial. 5. Collaboration is much more rewarding in person than remotely. what are we going to learn as a team</p> <p>Change makers lab is from 1pm -5pm  Is this classs monday as well?

I consume caffeine in order to stay awake, but it would be better to drink Matcha than Coffee.</p> <p>I took the Changemaker Lab in Fall 2022 and I learned lots of leaderships skills and workshopping skills. I love Destiny 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog. I cant wait to buy my new GPU so I can do more in programming and designs/modeling. I am excited to graduate this year with BS and get my cybersecurity. I am also excited to further my skills at game development.</p> <p>////FOR OCT 5 assignment This past week, I had to brush up on my programming and psuedocode skills that we learned in CSF. I have grown pretty comfortable with arrays and linked lists. My syntax skills have gotten better as I have been using Java API (I urge you to use that as a tool). I have also been practicing call function because that is a great skill to learn with arrays and linked lists.

I don't belive that I have ever taken a class here at Evergreen that is this level of \"all over the place.\" Code, and coding has never been my strong suit, but having to do a fair amount of it has been a good refresher. \\ Many times, I really feel as if I am totall lost in class, however I'm pretty sure that theres a fair amount of us that feel the same.  Skills are improving on how to do everthing in a co-created repository, I still worry that I am often doing something wrong. \\\\ end ///</p> <p>======= We learned that data structures are found commonly in everday life.</p> <p>They are used to organize data.</p> <p>Everyone has their own way of setting things up.</p> <p>Algorithms are processes that take an input state and put out an output state.</p> <p>They will always have an invariant, which is a known stating state.

Caffiene is my best friend. There will usually be an invarient of some kind. Nobody knows what we are doing, but it can be fun to pair with others to learn. Being lost is oddly helping me learn more, if that makes sense.</p> <p>Jonathan Rodriguez - Co-Creation 2 For those who would like to know, a hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. I like to split hash code into a 3 step process (Compute, Map, Avoid Collisions). There are many ways to deal hash code collisions such as linked lists, search trees, and linear probing. A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science. Think of it as a stack of plates where you can only remove or add plates to the top of the stack.  main</p>"},{"location":"week-01/2023-09-28/","title":"Week 1 - Day 2","text":"<p>Thursday, 2023 Sep 26</p> <p>Edit this Page on GitHub</p> <p>CTF Event announcement at 11am</p>"},{"location":"week-01/2023-09-28/#arrays-and-links-homework","title":"Arrays and Links Homework","text":"<p>(Due by next Wednesday, 3pm) (45 minutes in class)</p> <ul> <li>With a pair programming partner, in GitPod or your favorite development environment</li> <li>Create a branch containing your usernames and <code>array-links</code> somewhere.</li> <li>Change to <code>dsa-23au/java-dsa/array-links/src/main/resources</code> </li> <li>Export your dataset spreadsheet from above to a CSV file.

The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena, 3rd edition) \u2022   Contiguous arrays, while providing O(1) access, have limitations when resizing. \u2022   Linked lists cater to dynamic data storage requirements, offering efficient insertions and deletions at the expense of O(n) random access. \u2022   Stacks, with their LIFO nature, and queues, with their FIFO characteristic, are quintessential data structures for specific problem-solving paradigms. \u2022   Hash maps or dictionaries facilitate rapid key-value look-ups, with efficiency hinging on a robust hash function and effective collision handling.</p>"},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/","title":"Week 02 Readings","text":""},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/#cracking-the-coding-interview-mcdowell-the-green-book","title":"Cracking the Coding Interview (McDowell), the green book","text":"<ul> <li>Pages 30-31</li> <li> <p>Long-term Roadmap</p> </li> <li> <p>Pages 62-64</p> </li> <li> <p>Flow-chart, strategies</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapters 1-3</p> </li> <li> <p>Pages 88-99, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues</p> </li> <li> <p>Hash Table Collisions</p> </li> <li>p. 636</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/#the-algorithm-design-manual-skiena-the-red-book","title":"The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena), the red book","text":"<ul> <li>Chapter 3 up to 3.3</li> <li>Contiguous arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps (dictionaries)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/#data-structures-and-algorithm-analysis-in-java-weiss-the-red-and-white-book","title":"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java (Weiss), the red and white book","text":"<p>For DSA students doing Java.</p> <ul> <li>Sections 3.5 to 3.7</li> <li>LinkedList implementation, Stack ADT, Queue ADT</li> <li>Sections 5.1 to 5.7</li> <li>Hashing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-02/Week02/","title":"Week 02","text":"<p>Autumn 2023</p>"},{"location":"week-02/Week02/#assignments","title":"Assignments","text":"Main Link Canvas Link Reading Assignment 2 Canvas Link Knowledge Co-Creation 2 Canvas Link Java Assignment 2: Links-Stacks-Queues Canvas Link"},{"location":"week-02/Week02/#background-resources","title":"Background Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Real World Applications of Data Structures from Log2Base2</li> <li>Inserting an Element into an Array from Log2Base2</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/","title":"Week 3 - Day 6","text":"<p>9 October 2023</p>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#morning-session","title":"Morning Session","text":"<ul> <li>Pick a note taker from Zoom.</li> <li>A note about merges and resolving conflicts: don't regress / remove useful code by accident</li> <li>https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/commit/350cd9010805375df440355d5dbd040bc7ef3729#diff-dadd3662a440f83c19273fd8b4a9d15147a67949a7c4eb7eb40993b04ff0a9cb</li> <li>compile and run tests, </li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#first-hour","title":"First Hour","text":"<ul> <li>How to answer a question like: which operations are faster on arrays versus linked list?</li> <li>Resource usage</li> <li>Algorithmic Analysis</li> <li>Asymptotic Notation, Donald Knuth</li> <li>Definition, graphs</li> <li>Vocabulary</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#second-hour","title":"Second Hour","text":"<ul> <li>Software Leadership</li> <li>Knowing Who is working on what</li> <li>Gathering a list of tasks</li> <li>Determining an order</li> <li>Picking drivers and teams to come up and type.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#afternoon-session","title":"Afternoon Session","text":"<p>Cracking the Coding Interview</p>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-10/","title":"Week 3","text":"<p>10 October 2023</p>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-10/#course-notes","title":"Course Notes","text":"<p>Trinity please type here for the first hour: A computational resources: 1)Memory(Space) 2)Time</p> <p>Many Algorithms will use different scales depending on what is more efficient.</p> <p>Question that was asked in Zoom (Jonah Eadie): Is it also because those statistics will vary across different systems?

Thinking that Exponential functions are more efficient, but Quinn (aqqmin) clarified getting it closer to the constant time is better. In short, lower is better.

No dumbass, spaced repetition is a theory of learning that says if have a structured schedule of learning concepts, you can repeat them again at longer and longer intervals.
