Some students in the program have already studied data structures (DS &amp; A). Those students will be creating their own curriculum in groups. For students who want to learn DS &amp; A, the program syllabus will look like this:         </p> <p> <ul> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms;</li> <li>Team programming projects (with ChangeMakers)</li> <li>Synthesis of real-world problems with software modeling</li> <li>Software Engineering</li> </ul> </p> <p>         As computer science students, you will deepen your technical knowledge and skills required to understand, analyze, modify, and build complex software systems. The concepts and skills from Data Structures and Algorithms are key for software engineering and programming. Through this program you will also deepen your understanding of computing systems, both in theory and practice. The work will provide prerequisite knowledge for Evergreen's advanced computer science programs.\u00a0         </p> <p>         Working on team projects is very important for almost any job, especially in computer science. Also, at Evergreen we expect students to take charge of their learning. We make this easier by providing\u00a0 a caring and safe innovative team environment. This is ideal for those looking for a practical, hands-on approach to learning. This radically different pathway gives students the opportunity to set-up and run their own projects and ventures. Inspired by the pioneering Finnish \u2018Tiimiakatemia\u2019 approach, we designed this program collaboratively with the ChangeMaker Lab, which was the first to introduce this approach in the United States. The Tiimiakatemia ChangeMaker Lab is accredited by Tiimiakatemia Global\u00ae.         </p> <p>         In the first few weeks you will form a Team Company of up to 20 students, and work on real projects and research the programming, software engineering, and theoretical\u00a0 skills needed for those projects. You will gain entrepreneurial experience and learn how to operate and run an organization as a Holacratic structure. As a Team Entrepreneur, you\u2019ll work with your team in your own office environment virtually or in the classroom in our innovative open office space.\u00a0 You will create and manage projects around your passions, attend directors' meetings. You will have the opportunity to learn the auxiliary skills to manage budgets and build valuable contacts and networks.\u00a0         </p> <p>         You will learn by doing and specifically develop the following job skills: Self\u2010leadership skills, Project leading skills, Planning skills, Team Coaching skills, Strategic skills, Team leadership skills, Service, negotiation and selling skills, Understanding of financial issues, Marketing skills, Innovation skills, Team leadership skills, Data processing and IT \u2013skills, Team Learning skills, Creativity skills, International skills and Communication skills and work on developing Initiative, Courage to make choices and goal orientation.         </p> <p>         This full-time daytime program will be taught on the Olympia campus. Students who need to participate fully remotely should contact the faculty to discuss that option.         </p> <p>         Computer technology has an impact on almost anything we do, and data structures and algorithms are central to advanced study in computer science and to building large complex systems. When applying for positions such as Software Developer or Software Engineer, you will probably find that this program is the most important in helping you prepare for job interviews. In this program, you\u2019ll learn about ways to organize data (we\u2019ll see various data structures such as Lists, Trees, Graphs), ways to compare algorithms (we\u2019ll focus on space and time complexity using big Oh) and efficiently solve programming problems. It will also give you a chance to practice object-oriented and functional programming.         </p> <p>         We are so excited to work with all of you in this awesome program.         </p> <p>         We expect everyone to attend in person, unless you contact us to make alternative arrangements.         </p> Class Meeting Times <p>Monday</p> <p>Tuesday</p> <p>Wednesday</p> <p>Thursday</p> <p>Friday</p> 10am-1pm <p>Data Structures</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p>Systems and Teams</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Data Structures</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 12noon-1pm <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Forest Walk</p> <p></p> <p>&amp;nbps;</p> <p></p> <p>break</p> <p></p> <p>tutoring</p> <p></p> 1-3pm <p>Cracking the Coding Interview / Software Engineering</p> <p>(Evans 2617)</p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> 3-5pm <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>ChangeMaker Lab</p> <p>Sem2 C4105</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Textbooks:</p> <p>Required</p> <ul> <li>The Algorithm Design Manual, 3rd edition, by Steven Skiena ()</li> <li>Cracking the Coding Interview \u2013 189 programming questions and solutions, Gayle Laakmann McDowell, 6th edition (CCI)ISBN-13: 978-0984782857 </li> </ul> <p>Optional</p> <ul> <li>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 3rd or 4th edition, by Mark Allen Weiss</li> <li>Dive into Systems (DIS)\u00a0 Dive Into Systems Text: https://diveintosystems.org/development/antora/diveintosystems/1.0/index.html</li> <li>Parallel computing for Beginners https://www.learnpdc.org/PDCBeginners2e/</li> </ul> Concrete Examples Synthesis and Lateral Thinking Week 1 <p>A Self-Guided Tour</p> <p>RAM Model, Lists</p> <p>Arrays, Links, Counters</p> <p>Interfaces, CRUD Operations</p> <p>IntelliJ and Git: practice and warmup</p> <p>Pair Programming: what roles? what rules?</p> <p>Learning Log, ChatGPT / AI prompting</p> <p>ChangeMaker teams, learning together</p> Week 2 <p>Implementation vs. Interfaces</p> <p>Stacks, Queues</p> <p>Key-Value Maps, Hashing</p> <p>Collisions, Links</p> <p>Time-Space and Other Dualities, Resources</p> <p>How to trade off time for space, vice versa?</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Counting and visualizing resources: VisualVM</p> Week 3 <p>Asymptotic Analysis (Big O)</p> <p>Trees, Relations, Searching</p> <p>Traversals: Bread-first, Depth-First</p> <p>Heaps (Priority Queues)</p> <p>Recursion and Iteration</p> <p>Cleaning Up: Invariants, Rebalancing</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Overview of Final Project: Problem-Finding</p> Week 4 <p>Rebalancing Trees</p> <p>Red-Black Trees</p> <p>Rebalancing Heaps</p> <p>Inventing New Data Structures</p> <p>An Exotic Zoo: Fibonacci Forest, Skip Lists</p> <p>Amortized Analysis</p> <p>Combining two or more data structures</p> <p>Final Project Work: Collecting / Mocking Datasets</p> Week 5 <p>Maximum Subset Sum</p> <p>Dynamic Programming</p> <p>Interval Scheduling</p> <p>Satisficing (Greedy)</p> <p>Subproblems</p> <p>Memoizing / Caching</p> <p>Combining two or more algorithms</p> <p>Final Project Work: Collecting Datasets</p> Week 6 <p>Graphs</p> <p>Topological Sort, Dependencies</p> <p>Shortest Path (Dijkstra's)</p> <p>Network Flow</p> <p>MapQuest / Google Maps</p> <p>Find algorithms in the news</p> <p>Final Project Work: Designing Operations</p> <p>AI proompting and co-pilot: write code</p> Week 7 <p>Sorting, with Heaps and Trees</p> <p>Merge Sort</p> <p>Quicksort</p> <p>Radix Sort</p> <p>Randomized analysis</p> <p>Combining two sorts</p> <p>Joke Sorts: delay as much as possible</p> <p>Art: Pixel sorting</p> Week 8 <p>Database Indexes, Search</p> <p>Page Rank</p> <p>Linear Systems of Equations</p> <p>Constraint Satisfaction</p> <p>Boggle / Scrabble</p> <p>Final Project Work: Analysis and Correctness</p> <p>Find linear systems / constraints in real-life</p> <p>Connect DS &amp; A to another discipline</p> Week 9 <p>Karatsuba / Matrix Multiplication</p> <p>Divide and Conquer</p> <p>Streaming Algorithms</p> <p>Parallel Merge Sort</p> <p>Data Privacy</p> <p>Find algorithms in the news</p> <p>Parallelize a previous algorithm</p> <p>Final Project Work: Analysis and Correctness</p> Week 10 <p>Bonus Topics / Catchup Week</p> <p>Quantum DS &amp; A</p> <p>Recommender Systems</p> <p>Collaborative Filtering</p> <p>Finding Real World Examples: Go Local, Go Deep</p> <p>Final Project Work</p> <p>Synthesizing notes\u00a0</p> Tracks <p> Student who have never taken DSA before will take DSA in this quarter and participate in Changemakers team companies. They may choose either the Java programming language (with examples and support provided by DSA assignments) or any  other programming language where they must provide their own support and collaborate with each other.

Skills are improving on how to do everthing in a co-created repository, I still worry that I am often doing something wrong. \\\\ end ///</p> <p>======= We learned that data structures are found commonly in everday life.</p> <p>They are used to organize data.</p> <p>Everyone has their own way of setting things up.</p> <p>Algorithms are processes that take an input state and put out an output state.</p> <p>They will always have an invariant, which is a known stating state.

Being lost is oddly helping me learn more, if that makes sense.</p> <p>Jonathan Rodriguez - Co-Creation 2 For those who would like to know, a hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. I like to split hash code into a 3 step process (Compute, Map, Avoid Collisions). There are many ways to deal hash code collisions such as linked lists, search trees, and linear probing. A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science. Think of it as a stack of plates where you can only remove or add plates to the top of the stack.  main</p> <p>=================== Jon week 4  This week was very challenging for me regarding search trees. But the more and more that we practiced in class I do feel my grasp on them has gotten better. For my first project with Dante and Dawson I was thiniking implementing of the data structure that we used in class into our spotify data that we are collecting. As an update, we have to wait less than a month to recieve our spotify data. In the meantime, I can create designs for what our goals would be. An example can be making a class that checks our most listened to artist or song.</p> <p>Jonathan Week 6 This past week in DSA has been super helpful for me in developing and sharpening my skills. From our time in Gitpod working on the sorting algorithms, I am starting to become accustomed to debugging, especially using certain extensions. My attention to detail such as concise and legible syntax has shined from this week compared to how I started in CSF and a few weeks into the course. I\u2019ve also made a good habit of commenting on my code so that my peer-programmers can get some assistance on what to make of my code. I have also gotten much better at git commands with wanting to learn more in the future like unix and PowerShell. Version Control is something that I have become accustomed to now that we're pretty deep in the quarter (I am able to navigate through Github without bashing my head against the wall). I also believe my problem solving skills regarding code is more refined with understanding how methods are implemented and how they access or manipulate data in whatever project we are working on.</p> <p>======================= </p> <p>ndeanon25 - Nathan Deanon Notes from Week 3  - We learned the Orders of Growth, Big O notation, and how we want our code to get to O(1) for the most efficient time. - There is no clear answer on what the best data structure there is, it really just depends on what you need. Every data structure is useful in its own way. - A problem-solving flowchart is really useful and helps break down problems into smaller actions that you are able to work on. Listen to all the information, find an example, brute force, so find a solution ASAP and it does not matter if it is efficient. Solve manually on an example and try to reverse engineer it. Optimize, so look at B.U.D (any bottlenecks, unnecessary or duplicated work) to take out of your code.  - Singly linked lists are when each node points to the next node while doubly linked list is when each node points to both the next node and the previous node.  - Array list is used for dynamic sizing an array while providing O(1) access, so when an array is full, it doubles and takes O(n) but that does not happen a lot so it should still be efficient when running.     </p> <p>====================== </p> <p>ndeanon25 - Nathan Deanon  Notes from Week 4  - In-order transversal visits the nodes in ascending order. Pre-order transversal is when the root is always the first node visited. Post-order Transversal is when the root is the last node visited. - A Trie is a variant of an n-ary tree in which characters are stored at each node, while a graph is a collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them. - The two most common ways to search a graph are depth-first search and breath-first search. DFS starts at the root and explores each branch completely before moving on to the next branch. BFS starts at the root and explores each neighbor before going on to any of their children. - DFS is often used if we want to visit every node in the graph while BFS is used to find the shortest path between two nodes. - For adding runtimes, these are separated for loops. So, it is supposed to do this first loop and then when it is done with that, it does the second loop next. For multiplying the runtimes, it does the first loop and for each object it is iterating through, it must do another for loop. So, it is basically a do this, for each time you do that.     </p> <p>====================== </p> <p>ndeanon25 - Nathan Deanon  Notes from Week 6  - I worked on Codeacademy and was brushing up on my Java syntax, there are a few lessons on recursion that are helpful. They use a great example of when you are in a line, and you do not know how many people are in front of you. You do the inductive case and ask the person in front of you how many people are in front of you. Then, that person asks, and so on until you reach your base case, there is only one person in front of you, so it goes back, and the person says one person in front of me, then it goes back and says two people are in front of me. CodeAcademy is helpful with their lessons. - My final project is going okay, while I do have some methods and algorithms, I want to use for my lottery picks, it is difficult to start coding and just start from scratch. I have a couple of UMLs I created but besides that, it has been difficult to start it.  - I am also looking more into Binary Search Tree since my hangman project would use a BST to avoid the letter the player is choosing. - Visualgo is helpful with showing us the sorts and how it works. I enjoy the pseudocode and the diagrams that are easy to follow and see. At first, I did not understand merge sort but just following the diagram and seeing the code run in real-time helped me understand it.  - Also, the presentations that the ILC students were working on were interesting. Quinn with the web scraping RedFin using Selenium and Aspen taught us about XSS cross-site scripting attacks.

The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena, 3rd edition) \u2022   Contiguous arrays, while providing O(1) access, have limitations when resizing. \u2022   Linked lists cater to dynamic data storage requirements, offering efficient insertions and deletions at the expense of O(n) random access. \u2022   Stacks, with their LIFO nature, and queues, with their FIFO characteristic, are quintessential data structures for specific problem-solving paradigms. \u2022   Hash maps or dictionaries facilitate rapid key-value look-ups, with efficiency hinging on a robust hash function and effective collision handling.</p> <p>ndeanon25 - Nathan Deanon      Notes from Week 2 1) C.R.U.D means to create, read/search, update, delete/remove 2) Stacks are last in and first out while Queues are first in and first out. 3) The weaknesses of arrays are the slow insertion, fixed size, and inefficient memory allocation. While the linked list has fast insertion, dynamic sizing, and efficient memory allocation. The downside to linked lists is that they have a slow search time. 4) The reason we should code review is that it transfers knowledge from one person to another, and it helps to see someone's process to incorporate it into your own process. 5) I am still getting the hang of the GitPod so the steps are to make a new branch, write/modify code, commit, push a request, get a code review, and then delete the branch once reviewed and merged.    ==================================================================</p>"},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/","title":"Week 02 Readings","text":""},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/#cracking-the-coding-interview-mcdowell-the-green-book","title":"Cracking the Coding Interview (McDowell), the green book","text":"<ul> <li>Pages 30-31</li> <li> <p>Long-term Roadmap</p> </li> <li> <p>Pages 62-64</p> </li> <li> <p>Flow-chart, strategies</p> </li> <li> <p>Chapters 1-3</p> </li> <li> <p>Pages 88-99, Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues</p> </li> <li> <p>Hash Table Collisions</p> </li> <li>p. 636</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/#the-algorithm-design-manual-skiena-the-red-book","title":"The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena), the red book","text":"<ul> <li>Chapter 3 up to 3.3</li> <li>Contiguous arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps (dictionaries)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-02/Readings-02/#data-structures-and-algorithm-analysis-in-java-weiss-the-red-and-white-book","title":"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java (Weiss), the red and white book","text":"<p>For DSA students doing Java.</p> <ul> <li>Sections 3.5 to 3.7</li> <li>LinkedList implementation, Stack ADT, Queue ADT</li> <li>Sections 5.1 to 5.7</li> <li>Hashing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-02/Week02/","title":"Week 02","text":"<p>Autumn 2023</p>"},{"location":"week-02/Week02/#assignments","title":"Assignments","text":"Main Link Canvas Link Reading Assignment 2 Canvas Link Knowledge Co-Creation 2 Canvas Link Java Assignment 2: Links-Stacks-Queues Canvas Link"},{"location":"week-02/Week02/#background-resources","title":"Background Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Real World Applications of Data Structures from Log2Base2</li> <li>Inserting an Element into an Array from Log2Base2</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/","title":"Week 3 - Day 6","text":"<p>9 October 2023</p>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#morning-session","title":"Morning Session","text":"<ul> <li>Pick a note taker from Zoom.</li> <li>A note about merges and resolving conflicts: don't regress / remove useful code by accident</li> <li>https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/commit/350cd9010805375df440355d5dbd040bc7ef3729#diff-dadd3662a440f83c19273fd8b4a9d15147a67949a7c4eb7eb40993b04ff0a9cb</li> <li>compile and run tests, </li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#first-hour","title":"First Hour","text":"<ul> <li>How to answer a question like: which operations are faster on arrays versus linked list?</li> <li>Resource usage</li> <li>Algorithmic Analysis</li> <li>Asymptotic Notation, Donald Knuth</li> <li>Definition, graphs</li> <li>Vocabulary</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#second-hour","title":"Second Hour","text":"<ul> <li>Software Leadership</li> <li>Knowing Who is working on what</li> <li>Gathering a list of tasks</li> <li>Determining an order</li> <li>Picking drivers and teams to come up and type.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-09/#afternoon-session","title":"Afternoon Session","text":"<p>Cracking the Coding Interview</p>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-10/","title":"Week 3","text":"<p>10 October 2023</p>"},{"location":"week-03/2023-10-10/#course-notes","title":"Course Notes","text":"<p>Trinity please type here for the first hour: A computational resources: 1)Memory(Space) 2)Time</p> <p>Many Algorithms will use different scales depending on what is more efficient.</p> <p>Question that was asked in Zoom (Jonah Eadie): Is it also because those statistics will vary across different systems?

Neo and MNE are two that I\u2019ve been working closely with for the past few weeks. I was having issues with pandas \u201c4 values expected on line 19, only 3 found\u201d, a friend helped me fix it by opening the original csv in vs code instead of the renamed version. It apparently got corrupted when I renamed the file, causing a bunch of weird issues. Now it prints.</p> <p>Reflection: So far, I have learned more java syntax effectively than in the past few years combined, even when recommended to me by my old manager. I was in a group called \"learning effective java\" but even that didn't help.  I have also learned that there are far more data structures than I suspected previously and learned that it is important to evaluate them vs just picking the first structure that seems to get the job done. I have learned a great deal about the fundamentals which was my primary reason for taking this class. For problems, I have had problems with not having a modern enough computer to deal with the loss of GitPod access but I resolved that by spinning up an EC2 instance Linux machine. I also run into blank screen blockage when trying to sort out java and problems. I also had issues with discord but have since resolved them.</p> <p>Week 5 - AI for Learning How do you think the increasing availability and quality of AI chat and large learning models will affect the software industry in the near future? </p> <p>It is inevitable that AI will have an impact on the software industry. From enabling engineers to easily create more robust testing to copy-pasting incomplete, to becoming a sort of copyeditor for code writing. In my experience, one of the biggest obstacles to innovation is code rot. Engineers for years past writing code that is hard to read or in production so impossible to test changes. With ChatGPT, I could see a vital use-case where an engineer takes a bit of code and asks ChaptGPT to explain it and to add comments. You could then take those comments and update the code which is sometimes enough to take an unreadable code base to expand to a wider audience. Based on what I have seen in the classroom with ChpatGPT, I look back on those hours toiling over code and looking for answers in posts on stack overflow. The speed and accuracy of code-based questions seems very on point with the right questions. </p> <p>What will this mean for the future of software engineers? It is impossible to predict but if history is any prologue, then we can look back on similar instances of technology threatening a workforce. One may think of solar versus fossil fuels but that is more complex than a invention that threatened a single profession. As I recall from a radio broadcast snippet from NPR (KNKX, October 2023) a similar panic arose with the invention of the calculator. Mathematicians were alarmed that it would erase the need for them. But as the decades rolled on, this proved false where the calculator helped make better mathematicians reduce the time it took and improve the accuracy to do complex calculations. </p> <p>Here is an interesting listen to a podcast The Pulse: https://www.npr.org/2023/08/09/1192997798/will-a-i-take-your-job-or-make-it-better </p> <p>Trinity Hyre (Hiraeth_Awaits) : Reflection: Over these past weeks, I have learned more about java then I thought I would. Algorithms have been hard to understand for me, and since I am taking the Codecademy Pro Career path for computer science, I will go over it again in the next month or so. This class, thusfar, has helped kickstart my learning journey. I am confident that when it is time for me to redo Algorithms and data structures, I will have a basic enough understanding to work through it efficiently. I personally enjoyed learning how to make our own personal project spaces within the main branch, it was very helpful to go step by step with that process. What are you looking forward to, or could you look forward to, in the hackathon? Possibly learning more about the world of hacking. What are some concerns you have or challenges we might encounter in the hackathon? I feel as if it might be difficult for me to keep up with others, as I am not that skilled or informed with hacking. What well-defined, one-weeks' worth of difficulty piece of your final project do you hope to complete for your hackathon submission / entry? I hope to input the Spotify data that I collected, along with my groupmates, into an excel sheet to sort it. Then start on creating a program to sort it automatically. What resources, work, or tools (software or otherwise) do you think all of us will need to succeed in the hackathon, that we can prepare in advance? Caffiene and sleep.  How will you judge whether the week was a successful experience or not? If I at least tried to complete something, wrong or right, I will know I at least tried my best; therefore succeeding.</p> <p>Jonathan Rodriguez (JonR2002): Increasing the availability and quality of AI chat could provide signficant advancement for the software industry. These developments could bring about a range of changes, such as the automation of customer support, the creation of more user-friendly interfaces, content generation, tailored user experiences, enhanced data analysis, and improvements in software development processes. AI will also find applications in fields like security, healthcare, education, and entertainment. While these advancements could offer clear benefits in terms of efficiency and personalization, they also introduce challenges, including ethical concerns, regulatory considerations, and the potential for workforce displacement. To fully leverage the capabilities of AI models, the software industry must address these issues and invest in ongoing education for its workforce.  I am also very excited for the hackathon in a couple of weeks because of the oppurtunites that can arise from this. I am also very worried because this is also my first hackathon/coding competition or any of the sorts. I dont know what to expect apart from what I have heard from my other fellow classmates. Im hoping that the hackathon can harden my programming and coneptual computer science skills as well as providing concise and adoptable methodologies. </p> <p>Stella Parker (whereismyprozac): In the near future I think chat won\u2019t affect the software industry in a negative way, it is still in its very early stages despite being so advanced. Right now, it feels like chat will become another tool just like google but better. It\u2019s even creating more jobs; we\u2019ll need people to engineer and test prompts and always oil the machine. The image generating ai is what I am more worried about. Even though it\u2019s still mediocre, in a few years it will become too powerful. We are already struggling in the age of conspiracies and disinformation, image generating ai will just make everything much, much worse. We are already in a pit of despair that is filling up faster than we can recognize and it\u2019s probably too late. To avoid boredom, I chose my own language to write my project in. It feels more overwhelming to work with others sometimes. I hate explaining what I want from projects to other people and there\u2019s no guarantee that they will know how to do what you are trying to accomplish. As for in class work, I wish there were a lot more written instruction, or any at all. Some people have issues processing auditory information and it sucks to have to guess or ask the person next to you who also doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on because the projector is impossible to see and there are no written instructions.  I am not looking forward to the hackathon and I don\u2019t have any concerns about it. I\u2019ll probably submit my print results. The entire internet will be used for the hackathon. This week will be a success when it ends, and I haven\u2019t been hit by a car.</p> <p>Nathan Deanon(ndeanon25):       The increase of availability and quality of AI chat will help speed up our technological advances. AI does open many different outlets for people if used right. While people do not have to think of the technical aspect of coding, developers can focus more on bigger picture aspects like how the code works, and what can be improved. This will come with many downfalls like I believe many entry level jobs like doing SQL database, will be harder to find since many companies will just use AI for these. In retrospect, this has happened multiple times throughout history. It is about adapting to the directory of where the software industry is headed. Workers in the software industry will have to update their skills and be able integrate AI into their work. This is even stated by IBM that, \u201cAI will not completely replace humans, but those who use AI will replace those who do not.\u201d AI will become an important tool that will be needed to work in this industry. This shift will disrupt the current job flow, it will create multiple new jobs. It is even predicted by the World Economic Forum that AI and automation \u201cwill disrupt 85 million jobs globally by 2025, creating 97 million new roles.\u201d It will force humans and machines to work together but however widened the skill gap with the likeliness of \u201c44% of workers needing reskilling by 2028\u201d.        For my learning efforts to be on the right level of engagement, there have been multiple guidelines I have set for myself. It is easier to just copy and paste the code that ChatGPT writes down or some code I find online, but I want to be able to understand and see how the code functions in my head. I must be able to visualize how this certain data structure is used or how this algorithm calculates an answer. I try to find flow but creating the balance that the article talks about.  The balance between a challenge and my skill. I enjoy understanding algorithms and problem solving these challenges, but there are points where it feels out of my skill reach. This is the point where I feel overwhelmed and need to take a step back. I try to avoid copying and pasting implementations of methods, so I just start from scratch and build it up slowly. That is my philosophy has been lately, I am moving at my own pace and trying to break everything down into steps. This helps with seeing how the big picture.  Sources:  https://dig.watch/updates/ai-wont-replace-people-but-people-who-use-ai-will-replace-people-who-dont-ibms-report#:~:text=According%20to%20IBM%2C%20AI%20will,models%20and%20transform%20employees'%20work  https://alessiobresciani.com/productivity/finding-flow-at-work-20-tips-to-overcoming-overwhelm-eliminating-boredom/  </p> <p>Juniper Campbell (Lucretian)     The spreading of AI use an the development of job-specific AI will be, of course, disruptive. I am however cautious of any general narrative or assumption on what forms this disruption will take. Losses of jobs are not just an economic question but a political question and there will be coming tension surrounding potential regulations of the use of AI to reduce jobs. While many see AI as an obvious means to increase the productivity and profitability of a company I would not be so confident particularly in the long run. In the short run the value of companies seemingly increased by AI will likely be due to an increase in the value of their stocks due to the belief that AI will result in greater profitability. What interests me more is the disruption of public resources such as education and social services, particulalry with the debates currently surround government spending I have little doubt that there is much effort, however slow, to automate many gov service jobs, something that does not entail any competitive risks. It is important for people to recognize the development of AI and its impending social effects as not confined to the alien, inaccesible realm of \"the economy\" or the state but as a decisevly political issue that engenders the greater need to develop independent political structures by which we can capture lines of technological flight and regulate them towards human interests. As with every development of technological autonomation, the full implementation of its potentials will not be seen in an era of high consumption to investment ratios for the investor class, and will not move us any closer to actually living a life of less toil unless there are structures built to change our organization of time towards free-time. Beyond a few key constraints, our organization of the basic resource of time is arbitrary to different generative codes of production teleologies(purposes), better technology changes potentials and probabilities but does not nessecitate any benefit for humanity. </p>"},{"location":"week-05/Week5Co-Creation/#6-hackerthon-prelim-notes","title":"6 Hackerthon prelim-notes:","text":"<pre><code>\u2022 What are you looking forward to, or could you look forward to, in the hackathon?\n    \u25cb Looking forward to experiencing a hackathon in a different way.\n    \u25cb Looking forward to some solid coding session which is one of my fav things\n\u2022 What are some concerns you have or challenges we might encounter in the hackathon?\n    \u25cb Concerns is possibly getting distracted or going down a rabbit hole\n\u2022 What well-defined, one-weeks' worth of difficulty piece of your final project do you hope to complete for your hackathon submission / entry?\n    \u25cb Building the data structure and the methods to answer our questions\n\u2022 What resources, work, or tools (software or otherwise) do you think all of us will need to succeed in the hackathon, that we can prepare in advance?\n    \u25cb Coffee and lots of it.

If we want to make the best change possible, we want to consider a set of all combinations of coins from our denomination, or a set of sets.</p> <p>One such set of sets which in general is quite large, is called the Power Set. It is equivalent to enumerating the sets in an ordered way, for example first:</p> <ul> <li>Including the penny</li> <li>Not including the penny</li> </ul> <p>And then</p> <ul> <li>Including the nickel</li> <li>Not including the nickel</li> </ul> <p>Continuing in this way, we see we have two choices for each denomination, leading to 2^4 = 16 combinations.</p> <p>In general, for <code>n</code> denominations, its power set has <code>2^n</code> sets in it.</p> <p>You can also see this because the choice to include or not include can be encoded as a bit <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, and each set can be encoded as <code>n</code>-bit string, where the <code>0</code> means the denomination for that position was not chosen, and <code>1</code> means it was.</p> <p>This is the encoding for choosing 1 penny, 1 nickel, and 1 quarter, with the penny in the left-most bit, and the quarter in the right-most bit.</p> <pre><code>1101\n</code></pre> <p>Well, looping over 16 combinations doesn't seem like a big deal, but you may have noticed that none of these 16 actually adds up to 73 cents simply because we don't allow repetitions! It doesn't allow for choosing multiple coins of the same denomination (3 pennies for example).</p> <p>Well, how about now instead of binary strings, with only <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, we now allow any non-negative number. Here's the encoding of our answer above, 3 pennies, 2 dimes, 2 quarters.</p> <pre><code>3022\n</code></pre> <p>To get there, we would now have to search through <code>4 * 4 * 4 * 4</code> possibilities, because each denomination can have <code>0</code> chosen. (If you've been programming as hard as you've been for the past several weeks, you're used to things being off-by-one and beginning at zero here in cyberia.)</p> <p>Searching through 256 choices is also feasible, if we stop when the amount is greater than 73. Our enumeration might look like:</p> <pre><code>0000\n0001\n0002\n0010\n0011\n0012\n0020\n0021\n0022\n...\n</code></pre> <p>It's an exercise left to you to design a canonical enumeration, one that is regular enough you could write a program to do it. You're probably convinced it could be done, and it would take more steps than enumerating just bit strings.</p> <p>Well, let's say you are in charge of programming the change maker in a coin-operated vending machine, or a toll booth. Or your change-making machine now is selling in a country with different denominations (Pre-decimal British coins anyone?)</p> <p>Or you're in charge of supplying your company or army and have to choose between multiple provisions costing different amounts, taking up different amounts of space, and having different importances. (This is actually the knapsack problem, which in one version is solvable with dynamic programming, and in another version, is NP-complete and among the hardest problems we know how to solve exactly. If you're curious, try having a conversation with GPT about it.)</p> <p>You would like to come up with a general solution, and for more than just 73 cents, and it's possible you could enumerate each coin to infinity.</p> <p>It turns out, you might consider a kind of \"meta-enumeration\", where you not only choose coins from each denomination, but you also choose subsets of the denomination.</p>"},{"location":"week-07/2023-11-09/#physical-preparation","title":"Physical Preparation:","text":"<p>Open up Gitpod on the main branch to a fresh workspace in the <code>dynamic-programming</code> project.</p> <p></p> <p>Open the file <code>src/main/java/dev/codewithfriends/ChangeMakers.java</code></p>"},{"location":"week-07/2023-11-09/#recursive-solution","title":"Recursive Solution","text":"<p>This is also called a top-down solution because we start with the table entry that we want and work backwards to a base case, using recursive calls to the inductive case.</p> <p>As with all recursive approaches, this has a base case and an inductive case.</p> <p>The final table value is the answer we want:</p> <ul> <li>Answer = memo[(5, 73)]</li> </ul> <p>Meaning we want to count the number of ways to make change for 73 cents using 5 denominations.

These are my plans for my final project. I will have to implement methods for Tree transversal, Filtering words based on user choices using Hangman logic. I am thinking that I will have to create a BST class. It will make the node of the BST represent a word from the dictionary. When the user chooses a letter, traverse the BST to identify words that do not contain the chosen letter. This will keep a list of candidate words (initially containing all words) and narrow down this list as the user makes more letter choices. This continues the game based on the candidate's words until either the user guesses the word or runs out of attempts. My other idea is to investigate binary search for an array rather than putting it into a tree to simplify it. I will probably make a new list every time that the user chooses a letter and avoid the letter. </p> <p>We have learned alot about Java language in a short amount of time, In week 7 learning of the in and outs of Java programming , GitHub , GitPod and repositories has brought alot of satisfaction to a once daunting task.
