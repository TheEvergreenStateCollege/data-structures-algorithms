## Web Engineering (SOS) Tentative Syllabus
Winter 2024

## Learning Goals
* To understand the full stack of web applications, including front-end components and infrastructure.
* To practice technical interview skills through weekly mock interviews of submitted code and work.
* To complete a web application of at least 500 lines of code in teams.

## Tracks and Laps

Web Engineering has two tracks. Within each track, students who are taking it the first time should take Lap 1. Students taking it for the second time should take Lap 2.

### Track: Web Infrastructure
#### Lap 1: Cloud, Back-end

#### Lap 2: Rust

### Track: Web Front-End
#### Lap 1: Static Websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* [Complete Intro to Web Development v3]()

#### Lap 2: React + Typescript
* Intermediate React

#### Lap 3: Independent Topics
* For students who already have taken or know material in Lap 2 and Lap 1.
* React Native (2 weeks)
* Creative Coding (Canvas, WebGL, ThreeJS)

## Assessments and Evaluations
Students will be  asked to submit work to be evaluated in three categories
* 1/3 credit:
	* Weekly code interviews by TAs and instructor
	* Pass 5 out of 8 interviews for full credit
	* First interview is just demonstrating your AWS instance
* 1/3 credit:
	* Co-creation: add 5 sentences reflecting on your learning experience that week, and that of your pair programming partner.
* 1/3 credit:
	* Final project, 500 lines of code.

## Anticipated Credits

| Credits | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2* | Technical Interview Skills |
| 2* | Software Projects |
| 4* | Software Infrastructure for Web Engineering |
| 4* | Front End Software for Web Engineering |
| 4* | Computer Networking |

## Interactions Between Tracks
Students may be enrolled in one, two, or all three of the Front End, Infrastructure, and Networking tracks, and will be working in teams across all three tracks on their DSA final projects from fall quarter, or a new project that evolves over winter quarter.

* Front End students will be implementing a web app, with a client-side browser component
* Infrastructure students will be making the web app publicly accessible under a registered domain name, continuously integrated / deployed, reproducibly-built, with maximum uptime.
* Networking students will be analyzing the interactions between client-side and server-side components of the above teams, and helping them debug connectivity and security problems

These emulate product teams in software companies, in which engineers with different specialties divide up work and then integrate them with each other. Students who specialize in one track (e.g. Networking) may choose to take SOS again next year with a different specialization (e.g. Infrastructure).

## Required Textbooks by Track

TAs will receive used desk copies or PDFs of the readings, see Paul at beginning of the quarter.
