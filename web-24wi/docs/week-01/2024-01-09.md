## Web Inspector
The Web Inspector is a modern set of tools included in most major web browsers that is indispensable in understanding existing websites, as well as making your own websites.

* Elements / Inspector
	* The DOM (Document Object Model)
* Console
	* The Console is like a command-line interface for a website.
	* It's an interactive REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) that you can use to try out and learn through "programmatic" access to a website's state and structure.
## Code Pen
* CodePen is a website that gives you an online editor for HTML, CSS, Javascript with a live preview
* Go to the website https://pen.new
* In pairs, have the navigator dictate the index.html page to the driver in the HTML pane

* Switch driver and navigator, then dictate the styles.css into the CSS pane

More Complex Example
Now you will reproduce a more sophisticated example.
Go to the Google Type. Read through and explore for a few minutes with your partner.

Choose your favorite fable.
Open the web inspector and recreate just that section in a new CodePen.
