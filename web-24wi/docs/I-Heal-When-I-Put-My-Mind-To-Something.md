# A Note About Practice and Studying

`<sermon>`
This is not a class about copying and pasting. You are asked *not* to use AI chat, *to* type any character that you are borrowing, character-by-character and keystroke-by-keystroke, and *to* acknowledge the URL where you borrow any code by pasting it in a comment at the top of where you type it into your own code. There are two main reasons.
## Reason 1
If you have ever been frustrated by not being able to follow a lecture or demonstration that is going too fast, that is how your brain feels when your fingers only copy and paste: Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V is not enough to absorb what you are doing and to know what questions to ask. Asking questions is how you slow a demonstration down to the right speed.

You will need to watch the videos, do the readings, type the code yourself, and ask questions in order to learn.
### Reason 2
Over-reliance on AI chat, or internet search, or even your really good friend that you think is smarter than you'll ever be, all share one thing in common: they do not strengthen your ability to write code, and then communicate about what's going on to another human.

Also, it removes your ability to generate new code, which is what future students and future baby AIs will train from. The world needs your creativity, however humble you think its beginnings.

Coding from scratch and communication are fundamental skills to being a successful software engineer, even one augmented with the AI superpowers that we will all surely have in the future. I believe you can make progress if you want it, and you're willing to practice. As a bonus, having these skills has the side benefits of being able to pass technical interviews and being a good teammate. To put in the effort is difficult, uncomfortable, requires focus, makes you tired afterward, and feels like scribbling in the dirt with a stick and grunting to someone else. But it is a good kind of tired that will heal your mind. I am still learning how to do this after decades and need to practice every day. 
### Afterwards
After you are outside of this class, you can produce software however you want and that your users, fans, customers, and bosses accept. *This class* is only to show you a path, and help you walk it together with friends if you choose it.
