## Web Infrastructure - Morning Session

### Review from Last Week
* Created an API server in NodeJS and Express
* URL routes and route parameters
  * `
* Found repetitive tags in the DOM of popular websites that can be automated with loops
* Starting to replace CSV's as our data source
* Introduction to thinking about web interactions, web art, and final project
* Model-View-Controller paradigm

### This Week

Today in class, we will be following this [AWS EC2 Week 3]() setup documentation
to prepare for [Infra Homework 03](), Infra Homework 04 (to be published),
[Frontend Homework 03](), and Frontend Homework 04 (to be published).

#### Docker Containers (Briefly)

We introduce Docker briefly here because it is one way to automate
installation and configuration of a complex piece of software, the Postgres database.

[More details about why and how to use the Postgres Docker image are here](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-use-the-postgres-docker-official-image/).

We will cover containers in more detail in the second half of this quarter
as we are creating reproducible, deployable environments for your final projects.

Ways to Think of It
* Like a virtual machine (e.g. Virtual Box) but more performant
  * we virtualize the operating system (we can run Linux on Windows, e.g.) but we use bare metal hardware
* Like logging into a separate machine
  * but it is actually hosted locally alongside our host operating system
* A "guest" OS inside of the "host" OS
* We are running Docker inside of our AWS server
  * so there are multiple levels of nesting, it is easy to forget where we are at.
  * it helps to draw a system diagram

#### Databases

* Databases as a replacement for CSV's (imagine as a spreadsheet, which is a simple DB)
  * rows/datapoints and columns/fields
  * databases operate via transactions
    * (operations to insert, update, delete rows)
    * consider the operations 
  * databases have advantages over CSV files or spreadsheets
    * store and manage data separately from code (separation of concerns)
    * efficiency: databases use indexes (e.g. binary search trees) for fast lookup, binary optimizations
  * database have some disadvantages
    * have to backed up and restored separately from code
    * are generally not human-readable (in binary-optimized files)
    * more complex, require installing separate software
    * for structured queries, uses a separate language (SQL), on top of HTML/CSS/JS
    * often require dedicated staff (DB admins)
  * properties of a database (ACID)
    * atomic - either all of a transaction occurs or none of it does (no partial operations on a row or group of rows)
    * consistent - 
    * isolated - multiple readers and writers do not interfere with each other (every reader / writer acts as if it has exclusive access to the database in some serial history, or a known error occurs)
    * durable - transactions that have committed persist even if power goes out, program crashes, or other fault occurs.

#### Schemas, Data Models

[We will follow this introduction to database schemas from freecodecamp]().

* Schemas and models, as fields / columns of the CSV
* An Object Relational Mapping (ORM) via Prisma
* provides programmatic access to a database from a programming language
  * the database, programming language of the server, API middleware, and view language define a tech stack
    * well-known tech stacks are LAMP, MEAN, MERN, and ours PERN
  * in the MEAN stack, where MongoDB is the database instead of Postgres, Mongoose is a popular ORM
 
* Mob programming exercise
  * We examine 4 different ways to store data
    * hashmap in memory (Java HashMap or Javascript object)
    * CSV file on disk
    * redis key-value store, primarily in-memory for speed, but also caches to disk for persistence
    * (MongoDB) we don't have 

## Afternoon Session

* PDF Resume templates on Overleaf
* Hackerrank Practice
