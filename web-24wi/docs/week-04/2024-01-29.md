# Week 04 - Day 09
29 Jan 2024 - Monday

## Web Infrastructure - Morning Session

### Review from Last Week
* Created an API server in NodeJS and Express
* URL routes and route parameters
* Found repetitive tags in the DOM of popular websites that can be automated with loops
* Starting to replace CSV's as our data source
* Introduction to thinking about web interactions, web art, and final project
* Model-View-Controller paradigm

### This Week
* Databases as a replacement for CSV's (imagine as a spreadsheet, which is a simple DB)
  * rows/datapoints and columns/fields
  * databases operate via transactions
    * (operations to insert, update, delete rows)
    * consider the operations 
  * databases have advantages over CSV files or spreadsheets
    * store and manage data separately from code (separation of concerns)
    * efficiency: databases use indexes (e.g. binary search trees) for fast lookup, binary optimizations
  * database have some disadvantages
    * have to backed up and restored separately from code
    * are generally not human-readable (in binary-optimized files)
    * more complex, require installing separate software
    * for structured queries, uses a separate language (SQL), on top of HTML/CSS/JS
    * often require dedicated staff (DB admins)
  * properties of a database
    * atomic - either all of a transaction occurs or none of it does
    * consistent - 
    * isolated - multiple 
    * durable - 
* Schemas and models, as fields / columns of the CSV
* An Object Relational Mapping (ORM) via Prisma
* provides programmatic access to a database from a programming language
  * the database, programming language of the server, API middleware, and view language define a tech stack
    * well-known tech stacks are LAMP, MEAN, MERN, and ours PERN
  * in the MEAN stack, where MongoDB is the database instead of Postgres, Mongoose is a popular ORM
 
* Exercises
  * You have 4 different ways to store data
    * hashmap in memory (Java HashMap or Javascript object)
    * CSV file on disk
    * redis key-value store
    * MongoDB
    *
