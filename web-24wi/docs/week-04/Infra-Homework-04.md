# Web Infrastructure - Homework 04

## Lap 1: Cloud

For Lap 1 this week in Web Infrastructure, we have two goals
* allow users to authenticate to our API with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or passwords, and learn best practices for both

### Readings and Watchings

Read and/or watch these two sections of the API design with NodeJS and Express course.

Log into your AWS server and make changes to your API server from Infra HW 03 and HW 02, where you started your Prisma database schema and started making REST handlers for GET and POST methods for the Product / Update example.

[Section 6: Route & Error Handlers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/api-design-nodejs-v4/validation-overview/)

The entire course for reference, to give context to those sections, let you review previous sections, or look ahead to upcoming sections.
