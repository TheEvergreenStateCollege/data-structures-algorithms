## Software Setup

If needed:
Continue working on getting access to FrontEndMasters via the GitHub Student Developer Pack, or setting up GitHub Codespaces / your personal laptop development environment.

### Lap 2: React + Typescript

If you are doing Lap 2, you should still complete the Lap 1 project (Web Calculator) but with React components, in addition to the React project below.


### Readings and Watchings

Watch Section 4 of [Complete Intro to React](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v8/)  
* React Capabilities

### Write Code
Write and commit to the class monorepo, in your personal `assignments` directory.


Complete the Pet Photo Carousel project in your assignments directory, first creating this directory if necessary.  
```  
cd <repo_dir>/web-24wi/assignments/<github_username>/frontend/week2

```

When you are done, or at regular intervals, commit and push to GitHub.  
The first time, create a Pull Request.  
This is also a place where teaching staff and classmates can give you help and feedback.  
```  
git add .  
git commit -m "<describe your change>"  
git push -u origin <github_username>-week1  
```  
### Preparation for Code Interview  
You will receive your feedback and evaluation for this assignment next week by Canvas and a 1:1 in-person in-person code interview with teaching staff. Don't worry, do your best.

You can practice a mock interview with your classmates by following this script (as the interview)  
* Interviewer: Tell me about your code  
    * Interviewee: (if you don't know where to start, divide your code up into 4-5 sections, and describe their purpose in order)  
* Interviewer: (removes one random line of code without showing interviewee)  
    * Interviewee: (given time to re-run the code, understand what has happened, add it back, explain the purpose of that line, and how they came to that conclusion)

At any time, it is okay for the interviewee to say "I'm stuck, but here is what I am thinking. Can I have a hint?"
