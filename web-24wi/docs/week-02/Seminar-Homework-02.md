## The Hunt for Red Jobtober

### The Meta-Hunt 

Consider that you are trying to help your classmates find technical software internships. What unique or individual circumstances would you need to know, and what overall qualities are common to many people's desires in an internship?

For example:
* What are some keywords to search for in a posting title?
* What are some keywords to search for in a posting body?
* Is the internship remote, or tied to a geographical location?
* Is it full-time or part-time?
* What particular classes, experience, or skills are recommended?
* Do you have to be a U.S. citizen?
* Do you have to return to being a full-time student after the summer?
* Is it meant for a particular year (e.g. 3rd year student, 2nd year, any college level)
* What are the company's values, or how does it present itself to customers?
* What areas of technology does this person enjoy or find meaningful?
* What areas of technology does this person not enjoy or find distasteful?
* What size company?
* What non-material properties shine through the actual details of a job posting?

How would you conduct a search?
* Google / other search engine for internships
	* Also search for job fairs, in-person and virtual
* Job sites like Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor for large companies
	* Craigslist for small companies
	* What other boutique, quirky, or hipster job sites are there?
* Ask Evergreen alumni on discord what companies they work for or got accepted to
* Ask Evergreen alumni on LinkedIn what companies they work for or got accepted to
* Search by cultural values and many other job factors at
	* https://www.keyvalues.com/
* What newsletters (substack, medium) 
* What meetup events

For the application process:
* How many should you apply to?
* In what order should you apply?
* How should you keep track of your applications?
* What emotional support can you offer other classmates as you all apply together?

What other questions are missing from the list above?

Submit your answers to the above in Canvas, and read and provide peer feedback on at least two others.
