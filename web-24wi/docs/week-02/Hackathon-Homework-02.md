## Start Off Your January Hackathon

#### 1. Register for MLH's month-long January hackathon (13 days left until submission deadline on January 31st).

(Sign-in with your GitHub account, then register for this event. No need to create a separate Devpost account).

#### 2. Write a profile for yourself with your skills and interests.

[On this Canvas assignment](), submit a link to your Devpost profile, and a summary of a new Devpost project you'd like to work on for January. (This is only a paragraph, you can flesh it out later). We'll talk about this more on Friday, January 18th, 10am.

Remember, this should be a subproject of, a prototype for, or otherwise related to your final project for Web Engineering this quarter. No need to create a separate project, and consider focusing on only this one team during the duration of this hackathon.

#### 3. Search for teammates at other schools here:

Three or four is the ideal team-size. It is okay to match up with other Evergreen students via Devpost. The goal is to have more fun, make new friends, exchange perspectives with other students, and complement your skillsets and learning styles.

#### 4. Come up with a plan... and motivation

There are many different ways to break up a large task into doable chunks so that a team can work on them. We don't recommend any particular one right now, but we think having a plan is important, even if you change or don't stick to the plan (and often we need to discard, modify, or scramble out).

What makes you fired up about this project?
What would make it hard for you to sleep it night, or get you up early in the morning, because you are curious or driven to see it exist in the world?

We'll be trying out and customizing various methodologies, such as scrum, before settling into a rhythm by SOS Spring 2024, when we begin Software Construction.
