It is usually not enough to learn a series of capabilities and technologies to truly appreciate the web, especially as a cultural medium, with the same wonder, anxiety, and awkwardness that greeted it in the 90s.

Short of stepping into an actual time machine, we can examine two social practices which still survive today: personal websites and webrings.

Personal websites, as the name suggest, usually represents the tastes or point-of-view of a single person. It can be an online shrine to your cat, a web journal documenting your hobby, a photo gallery to embarrass your friends, a philosophical manifesto, your scene-by-scene of what made a TV show great or terrible. The original hub for hosting these websites, which let users upload the HTML, CSS, and JS files that we have become familiar with.
