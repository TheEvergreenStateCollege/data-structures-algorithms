# Week 05 - Day 

## Web Infra - Morning Session

1st Hour:
Discussing data and Express 

Synonymous:
{ REST , API,  backend server } routes

2nd Hour:
Analyzing data needs behind the userflow and wireframe diagrams from last Thursday

Reminder:
come up with userflow / wireframe for practice demo fair *this* Thursday morning

### Data and Relations


## Relations vs. other Mathematical Objects
### Linear Function Table

### Changelog Example

The data model we have been using in FrontEndMasters so far to set up the Prisma ORM, the Postgres database, and our Express REST server is inspired by this website:

#### Question for DSA Students

Are graphs equivalent in expressive power to relational databases?

That is, can any system which is representable in a relational database also representable in a graph? What about vice versa?

If you are interested, try drawing a graph to represent the example data of inventors and their product updates above.

Java/Python/NodeJS program loading from CSV on same computer
* Arrange the cards in a certain order (the CSV file)
* Take a picture of the 


The ORM includes the following parts
* A schema, or model, of what the data looks like.
	* This is the `M` in the MVC paradigm, and are the column names in our CSV.
	* It's the fields, their names and types, that every row or datapoint or record in our dataset will have.
	* This will rule out a whole class of errors and messy data as soon as possible. The database, and the ORM, will help us by doing this "typechecking" every time we enter in new data, to make sure our dataset begins and stays in a valid state.
* A client
	* This is tailored to our database type (Postgres) and our programming language of choice (Javascript).
* Migrations
	* Starting with Ruby on Rails in the 2000s, web startups discovered that a key part of keeping consistent data and making reliable web apps was, counter-intuitively, keeping track of all changes to the schema over time.
	* This may seem weird, 

### In-Class Activity
Creating a user in the database

1. Log into your AWS server

Make sure you have Postgres installed following these steps: [https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/blob/main/web-24wi/docs/AWS-EC2-Setup.md#week-3](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/blob/main/web-24wi/docs/AWS-EC2-Setup.md#week-3 "https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/blob/main/web-24wi/docs/AWS-EC2-Setup.md#week-3")

2. Change to the directory with your API server It should have a server.js

2a. In this directory, create a `.env` file which will contain the following line, which is a key-value pair

`DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:lol@localhost:5432/dev'`

3. Run `npx prisma init` if you donâ€™t have a prisma/schema.prisma file

3a. copy the schemas into prisma/schema.prisma [https://hendrixer.github.io/API-design-v4/lessons/data-modeling/creating-models](https://hendrixer.github.io/API-design-v4/lessons/data-modeling/creating-models "https://hendrixer.github.io/API-design-v4/lessons/data-modeling/creating-models")

4. Format the foreign key relations with`npx prisma format` and then generate the client with

`npx prisma generate`

5. Migrate the schema to the Postgres DB`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`

Open one of the `prisma/migrations/*.sql` files and try to explain to a pair programming partner what is going on.

6. Open your server.js and add the following

![[Pasted image 20240205205821.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240205205935.png]]
in the POST handler above, add a line at the end to respond to the client with
```
res.json(req.body);
```
that way, when you call `curl` to test this POST handler in the step below, you'll receive back the username the server receives (and a blank password, because we currently don't save it).

7. Start a `tmux` and create a second pane with splitting screen vertically:

- Ctrl+B (then let go of all keys) %

To switch between the two panes

- Ctrl+B (then let go of all keys) leftarrow
- Ctrl+B (then let go of all keys) rightarrow

8. Start your server with `node server.js`

9. In the second pane, make a curl call to create a user

`curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5000/user -d '{ "username": "def", "password": "123" }'`
