# Week 05 - Thursday

## Web Front-End - Morning Session

Practice Demo Day

On Thursday morning, Feb 8th, at 10am, we will have the following activities, during our normal Web Front-End class time. It will be organized by the TAs, who will divide the class into two shifts, just like the real Demo Day at the end of Week 10.

You will log into your computers as normal, but treat it as a "Shop Window" where you are open to business during either the first shift (Shift A) or the second shift (Shift B), presenting to potential teammates and ask for feedback. "Customers", or potential teammates, will come by to talk to you about your idea, and filling out feedback forms. Halfway through, Shift B will go back to their shop windows, and Shift A will now go around as customers.

* 15 minute introduction, everyone logs in and prepares their "Shop Window"
	* Put out your userflow and wireframe diagrams prepared in [Final-Project-05](Final-Project-05.md)
	* Open your web browser to show any relevant code, demos, example interactions, or slides.
* 45 minutes: Shift A is open for business at their "shop windows",
	* Shift B moves around and are feedback customers
* 45 minutes: Shift B is "open for business" at their shop windows,
	* Shift A moves around and are feedback customers
* 15 minutes: everyone finishes up feedback forms, debrief, conclusion
