### Second Hour

Receive back a userflow and wireframe diagram from the previous Thursday, drawn by someone other than yourself. (Don't pick your diagram back).

Find a pair programming partner and do the following activity. Create an directory for it in your assignments directory, on your laptop / GitPod / GitHub Codespace. (Not your AWS server)

```
cd <REPO_DIR>/web-24wi/assignments/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/frontend
mkdir week5
cd week5
```

* Make a skeleton HTML / CSS / JS static website (Lap 1) or a skeleton React app (Lap 2)
	implementing one of the wireframes, or a pagetype in the userflow diagram with sufficient detail. Timebox yourself to spend 30 minutes to get the main `div`'s and a few big features right (like a logo).
	* Avoid going to the original website that it is based on. Try to go only on the drawing.
	* Collect at least 5 questions, or details that you wish you could ask the diagram author, as you're working. Write these into a README.md 
	* The goal of this exercise is to help guide you in drawing your own final project userflow and wireframe in [Final-Project-05](Final-Project-05.md)
* Draw up a schema of the data that is represented by this website.
	* Use the Entity Relationship diagram that we learned from [2024-02-05](2024-02-05.md)
	* You should aim to have at least 3 different tables, with at least one relation with a foreign key.
	* The goal of this exercise is to help guide you in drawing up a database schema for your final project.
	* Add to your README.md markdown file in this directory and draw your ER diagram using Mermaid.
