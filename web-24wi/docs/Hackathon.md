For those in the hackathon track's 2 credits, we ask you to register for *and submit* projects to three online hackathons during winter quarter.

We recommend one of them be the Major League Hacking's events, because you will receive a free domain registration at GoDaddy that you can use for your final overall project for Web Engineering.
