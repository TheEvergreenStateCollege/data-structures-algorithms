### Reading

[Rust Book: Chapter 20 - Web Server Project](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

It's okay to skip [Rust Book: Chapter 19 Advanced Features](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch19-00-advanced-features.html) for now unless you finish Chapter 20 early, or experience some of the errors mentioned in Chapter 19 and want a reference to go back and learn more about them.

### Code Interview
In your code interview this week, answer the quizzes in each chapter in front of the TA and say a few words explaining them.
