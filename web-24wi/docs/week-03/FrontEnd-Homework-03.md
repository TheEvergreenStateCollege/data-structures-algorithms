### Lap 2: React + Typescript

Our goal in this assignment is to learn how to make modal dialogs in React, use custom hooks to improve performance, and learn the Tailwind CSS library of utility classes to style our React apps with grids, responsive layouts, more quickly and easily.

### Readings and Watchings

Watch Sections 5 and 6 of [Complete Intro to React](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v8/)  
* 

Watch Sections 1, 2, and 3 of [Intermediate React]()
* [Introduction](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v5/introduction/)
* [React Hooks](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v5/useref/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v5/adoptme-project-setup/)
### Write Code
Write and commit to the class monorepo, in your personal `assignments` directory.


Complete the modal exercise described here, for a confirmation box that appears over the rest of the web app, along with a responsive Tailwind css layout for the AdoptMe pet website from the previous homeworks. You may copy over the `week2` project and create the `week3` project if it doesn't already exist.


```  
cd <repo_dir>/web-24wi/assignments/<github_username>/frontend/
cp -prv week2 week3
```

When you are done, or at regular intervals, commit and push to GitHub.  
The first time, create a Pull Request.  
This is also a place where teaching staff and classmates can give you help and feedback.  
```  
git add .  
git commit -m "<describe your change>"  
git push -u origin <github_username>-week2  
```
