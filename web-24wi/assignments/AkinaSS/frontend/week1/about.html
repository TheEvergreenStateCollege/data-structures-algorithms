        <p>My name is Duc Nguyen. Currently, I'm living in Lacey, Washington with my family but orinally, I came from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.</p>
        <p>I'm a student at The Evergreen State College. I used to have a part-time job as a food worker in Carl's Jr, but I got busy so I leave that aside for now.</p>
        <p>I would be happy if anyone gave me some advice on whether if I'm doing okay in general or maybe just talk about something else.</p>
        <p>Here are some interesting fact about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I'm usually not a talkative person, or more of like your average weeb type. But lots of people said I'm a good listener, I don't think that's really true in some ways since I easily got phased out"</li>
            <li>"My hobby is generally focus on video games and anime, which would explain if I arkwardly got a lot of knowledge about them, even if I haven't read them yet"</li>
            <li>"My country's life is totally very different from what I live here. The life of city center and the life of a surburb really kicks up the difference, you guys need to try once"</li>
            <li>"I don't trust myself to be a good driver, partly because of racing genre animes and videos games influence me to drive offensively (not dangerouly) unlike what I should usually drive sometimes"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I don't have anymore things to show, so here's a random video about cars racing each other</p>
