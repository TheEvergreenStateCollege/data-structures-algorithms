// Import necessary Java libraries for everything 
// include input/output, mathematical operations, security, and data structures.

// Define a class named Result to encapsulate the logic for checking balanced sums.
// Give your Arraylist of numbers as a parameter

// Create method to determine if there exists an element in the array such that the sum of elements on its left
// is equal to the sum of elements on its right.
    
// Create a number counter for the array, if there's only one element, it satisfies the condition.

// Calculate the total sum of all elements in the array.

//Initialize and calculate the sum of elements to the left of the current element.

//If found an element that satisfies the condition return yes, else return no

//If it's fail the check then add the sum on the left with current element

//In default case, no element satisfies the condition.
