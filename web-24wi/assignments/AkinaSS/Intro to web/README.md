#**Folder info**

Hey all,

- This is my personal folder mostly contains my homework and other related things in Introduction to Web Programming courses at Evergreen taught by Richard Loke
- I got lazy to store this in my device since I want to keep my hard drive tidy, but thought that someone may need it as an introduction to html and css, so I put this in this quarter folder, so that to either keep my hard drive clean or someone could scroll through the introduction of using html and css and gets a handle on what happened
- assignment1 is the original homework folder, with _MACOSX being the original homework folder that's MAC OS compatible so that it can also be run on a MAC machine. There's also a zip file below it that contains both of these folder so that you could download it for your own use, these folders are just demonstration of what's inside that zip file
- myhwassignment is my current work folder for the course, you can observe them to see how it looks in the web or how I would approach it, but *please don't make any changes to it*. You can make a copy and make changes to it though, just use **cp myhwassignment "place you want to store it"** in a linux terminal
- After all, I just want easy 4 credits in this quarter though so again, **please don't make any changes to the main file, both the original and my modified version of it so that it could be used for others later on, remember you can download the zip file for your own use**, it's all my work for the submission of this quarter and that would be helpful if you don't change it to ways I can't intercept it or just want to be a menace and make a hard time to me. Plus there's an option to copy files and you can definitely make a copy of it, just don't choose violence when you wake up one day though (.-.)

That's all, hope you all have a good day and thanks for checking this MD file

**Stay sideways**
