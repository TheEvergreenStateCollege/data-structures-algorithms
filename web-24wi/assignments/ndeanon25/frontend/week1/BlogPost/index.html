        I am working on a Computer Science degree at Evergreen. I have plenty of 
        hobbies like watching sports, playing video games,

            This city is great, from the looks of it. It has big aspirations and the entrances are beautiful. The city is alive and there is so many levels
            of society that it feels like our own reality. In Atlantis, there are beautiful building and plants everywhere. There is even a waterfall
            in the middle of the city. On the downside, it is built on a hill, and the less fortunate are stuck living in the basement with terrible living conditions.
            Overall, the city feels real and alive.

          <p>
            There are plenty of missions with great stories. On the downside, there are plenty of missions that just feels like dirty work and terrible pay. 
            For example, there is a faction missions that give a great story as you dive deeper into the downfall of Londinion. Then there is a mission where 
            you place these beams around plants.The city overall is interesting and with so many missions coming from the first city you encounter, the player
            will have to get to know Atlantis.
