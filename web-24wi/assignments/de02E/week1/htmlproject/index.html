            <p> Ahh, the pomegranate. Red on the outside, red on the inside, with red seeds. The only non-red part would be the white barriers in the center dividing the seed pods. Truly the reddest of fruits.</p>
            <p>The pomegranate is said to have many red seeds inside of it, all with juice as red as the pomegranate's skin. What isn't there to love about this crimson berry?</p>

            <p>Green, green green! This fruit is all about the green. Cousin of the yellow lemon, this lime takes the original yellow skin from the classic you all love, and puts a new, cooler spin on it. does this tiny citrus deserve your approval? Well, that's for you to decide.</p>
