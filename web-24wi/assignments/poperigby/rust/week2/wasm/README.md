# Things I Learned

* WebGL
    * Shaders: Small programs that run on the GPU and can manipulate pixels to create rendering effects
        * Vertex shaders: Manipulate vertices
        * Fragment shaders: Can manipulate colors inside a shape. Trying to lookup what it did beyond that broke my brain.
