# Things I learned

* WebGL
    * Canvas/rendering context: The place where you draw all your graphics ðŸŒˆ
    * Shaders: Small programs that run on the GPU and can manipulate pixels to create rendering effects
        * Vertex shaders: Manipulate vertices
        * Fragment shaders: Can manipulate colors inside a shape. Trying to lookup what it did beyond that broke my brain.
    * Vertex buffer: A buffer where vertex data can be uploaded and modified before drawing to the canvas, instead of directly drawing to the canvas and manipulating vertices afterwards.

# Problems I ran in to

* CORS was blocked when serving my `index.html` from a file, so I had to launch a web server
* It appears I forgot to add the `pkg` dependency, which seems to have been important
* I misspelled "coordinates" as "cordinates" and the whole thing failed with the least useful error message possible :/
