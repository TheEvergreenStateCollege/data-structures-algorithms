    <p>
        I visted Alaska when I was in 5th grade on a cruise ship with my grandparents. There was so much to see and new things 
        I have never seen such as whales jumping out of the ocean, glaciers, and other wildlife. It was a chilly visit, but totally worth it
        and would do it again!

    <h3>Germany</h3>

    <p>
       I went to see family in 2016 and 2019, from great food and deserts that did not have so much sugar!; to seeing castles from the car window, to being aorund a country whose favorite 
       sport is soccer, parts of me wish I was born there. The food is amazing like I said, but I would have been a much better soccer 
       player. I Can't wait to go back.

    <h4>Bali</h4>

    <p>
        I went to Bali in 2017. The flight was the longest ever I fell asleep on a plane for the first time! This is where I truly got to 
        experience another culture. I got to eat amazing food, feed monkeys, wash an elephant, visit temples where religous practices are held. 
        It was so different from the U.S.

    <h5>Hawaii</h5>

    <p>
        Hawii feels like heaven to me. The weather was never bad, and when it rained, I still wanted to go to the beach and the water 
        felt great. From adventrous hikes, to endless amazing beaches to snorkel and see fish and sea turtles, to having some of the 
        best fruit (mangos, star fruit and more) to snack on, this was a heaven to me that I wish to visit again one day.
