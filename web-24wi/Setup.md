# Setup

To access the necessary resources for this class, you'll need to set up the following online accounts. In addition, you have several choices to set up development environments, depending on your preferences and what machines you have available to you.


We will continue to use the same GitPod workspace that you've 
become familiar with in the previous quarter.

## Development Environments

### GitHub Codespaces

Follow the setup in.

### GitPod
You can use the GitPod cloud development environment from last quarter in DSA. Be sure to create a new workspace from the `upper-division-cs` monorepo to pick up the latest GitPod Dockerfile. You can delete any old workspaces if there are no unsaved changes.

## Enable and Register Accounts

We will be following curricula from the Front End Masters website,
focusing on Typescript, React, NextJS with some later topics on 3D programming.

These accounts are needed for both the Web Front-End and Web Infrastructure tracks.
### GitHub Student Developer Pack
You will have 6 months free access to Front End Masters as part of
the GitHub Student Developer Pack. If you haven't already enabled 
your benefits to your GitHub account (created in Autumn '23 quarter)

https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student 

It may take a few days for GitHub to approve your Student Developer 
Pack benefits. Until they're enabled, you won't be able to access 
the Front End Masters website. Don't worry, the first week of
Engineering for the Web will include self-contained exercises that
you can do while waiting.

### Front End Masters

Once you're GitHub student benefits are enabled (you'll receive
a notification in your email), you can create a Front End Masters
account using those benefits here:
