# Student Originated Software
## Web Front End and Web Infrastructure

## Tracks 

There are three tracks for SOS.
Within each track, there are two *laps*,
one for students who have never done any web Engineering
before, and one for students who already have some
experience and want to learn a more advanced topic.

You will be assigned to a lap at the end of the first week
as part of your Week 1 Code Interview, and will stay with 
it for the rest of the quarter. If you take Lap 1 this quarter,
you may take Web Engineering
or its equivalent next year (in Winter 2025) in Lap 2 to learn
more advanced topics and pair program with students in Lap 1.

Both laps count for upper division computer science credits.
