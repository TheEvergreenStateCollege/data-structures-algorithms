# Track: Web Front End Engineering
Web Front End Engineering refers to all software, systems, engineering considerations, and user interface components that run on a user's machine, especially in their web browser. It is like the payload of the Moon lander or the Mars rover, which is a robot full of functionality that is meant to operate remotely in a faraway and hostile environment, communicating with Mission Control back on Earth. The rocket and technology that launches the robot into space and brings it in for a landing is like Web Infrastructure: once the Web Front End "payload" arrives in the user's browser, it unpacks and unfolds itself, and is rendered to create websites, clickable buttons, animations, videos, sounds, etc., communicating back with Web Infrastructure as necessary.
