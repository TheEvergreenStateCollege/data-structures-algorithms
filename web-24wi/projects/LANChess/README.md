## Documentation

### Pages

#### Login Page
Here the user can register or login with an account using a simple username and password.


#### Home Page
Here the user can either create a new online game which will provide them a code for a friend to search for. Or if the user's friend already has an online game started they can put the code into the textbox and click search to join!

### Clients
#### Local Game Client
To play online the user will need an account, but the local game feature can be accessed from anywhere, just click the 'local game' icon and start playing on the same monitor!

#### Online Game Client
This is the client that connects both players in a match to one another and render the subsequent board.

## Board rendering with chessboard.js

This library is used in the project to render a the chessboard and piece configuration of an FEN string to the screen. We decided to take a unique approach to creating an online chess application by rendering each board using FEN strings and not just by altering current board states with move notation. We did this mainly out of curiosity as we don't know of any project that has done it this way, but have yet to see if there exists any technical advantages to this method.

You can edit board configurations within the clients using the var config object. The clients then render the board according to the needed conditions of the game.
```
    var config = {
        //Static configurations
        showNotation: false,
        draggable: true,
        moveSpeed: 'slow',
        snapbackSpeed: 1000,
        snapSpeed: 200,
        dropOffBoard: 'snapback',
        position: localBoardCache, //This is the board state the user should always be seeing.
        orientation: orientationBufferLocal //This should change dynamically depending on what side the player is playing as represented by the colorOfPiecesForUser as a string of either "White" or "Black".
    };

    localBoard = Chessboard('board', config);
    localBoardCache = localBoard.fen();
}
```
