## Inspiration

Being an Apple watch owner and an eager to learn programmer. 

## What it does

This web application allows a user to create an account, then pick from many options that an apple watch tracks such as steps, distance sound level etc. Since at the moment, there is no way to sync live data from the watch to a web application, the user will have to manually type in their results from there health app and create their very own chart. 

## How we built it

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Prisma. 

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge for this project was the backend. While I got some backend functionality, there is still problems with it and I spent countless hours on it more than the frontend. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I would say everything, but to be more specific, the backend. It was the hardest and after many hours of work on it, I could POST users and run a script to POST watch data. 

## What we learned

I learned front and backend web engineering.  

## What's next for Apple Watch Data Viewer

The next steps is to continue to work on the backend. I also want to finish all the option pages and add more in the future, at the moment, I have a steps and disatnce pages. I also want to make the pages look better so better styling in the future. Another feature I want to add is for a user to upload a csv file that adds to the charts instead of just manually typing every points. This will be a partual solution to not being apple to use HealthKit unless I create an IOS app. So lots of ideas and feel free to share yours!
