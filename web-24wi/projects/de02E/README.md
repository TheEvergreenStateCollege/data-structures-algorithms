## Inspiration
I wanted to map out events to numbers of messages per day in a server, and decided that a handy website would help me.
## What it does
It allows you to check the messages sent in discord server over the course of one day in a range, with fancy html/css decorations and nift features.
## How we built it
I started making html files and css files and javascript files. I made some graphics and used some royalty free graphics
## Challenges we ran into
The javascript files were fairly hard, but I managed to get them to work by importing the JSON manually.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the specific dates page to work was awesome, and so was getting an areamap to work.
## What we learned
I learned what css animations were, and a lot about css and html in general.
## What's next for Discord Server Tracker
Adding the rest of the navigation pages, getting the login/registration features to function.
