I have the main menu accessible on the index page so that I don't have to log in each time.<br> 
I have logged in once!!! It was a challange to get the profile creation and then the user login features to function correctly...<br>

and I'm not sure I like the verticle footer, maybe make it thinner... or not have a verticle footer...
