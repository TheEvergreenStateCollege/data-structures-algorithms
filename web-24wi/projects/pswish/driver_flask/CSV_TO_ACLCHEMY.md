To use SQLAlchemy with your CSV data for performing calculations, you'll first need to define a SQLAlchemy model that represents your data structure. Based on your CSV sample, you can create a model like this:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean, DateTime, Float
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Trip(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'trips'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    time = Column(Integer)
    date = Column(String)
    elapsed = Column(String)
    orig = Column(String)
    dest = Column(String)
    detour_enroute = Column(Boolean)
    driver = Column(String)
    distance = Column(Float)
```

Once you have defined the model, you can use SQLAlchemy to create a database session, read data from your CSV file, and insert it into the database:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
import csv

# Create an engine
engine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@localhost/mydatabase')

# Create tables based on the Trip model
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

# Create a session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Read data from CSV and insert into the database
with open('your_csv_file.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        trip = Trip(
            time=int(row['Time']),
            date=row['Date'],
            elapsed=row['Elapsed'],
            orig=row['Orig'],
            dest=row['Dest'],
            detour_enroute=row['Detour enroute'].lower() == 'yes',
            driver=row['Driver'],
            distance=float(row['Distance'].split()[0])  # Extracting the numeric part of distance
        )
        session.add(trip)

session.commit()
```

Once your data is in the database, you can perform calculations and queries using SQLAlchemy's powerful ORM capabilities. For example, to calculate the total distance traveled by all drivers, you could do:

```python
from sqlalchemy import func

total_distance = session.query(func.sum(Trip.distance)).scalar()
print("Total distance traveled by all drivers:", total_distance)
```

This is a basic example, and depending on your specific calculations and requirements, you can write more complex queries and calculations using SQLAlchemy.
