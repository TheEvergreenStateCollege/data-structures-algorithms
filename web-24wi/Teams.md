You are asked to complete a final project during this Winter Quarter of SOS in a team of two or three people. Please ask the instructor if you would like to work on a solo team. Teams span across all three main tracks:
* Front End
* Infrastructure
* Networking

## Members Across Tracks 

Each team should have at least two members in every track, for the purpose of pair programming. Each member may take multiple tracks; for example, you may be implementing both the Front End and Infrastructure for your team final project, or you may be only doing the Front End and partnering with someone who will be taking care of the infrastructure.

Just as an example, you can see the teaching staff in their own team below. Jeff Cook would be helping with the web front end (user interface) and the web infrastructure along with Paul Pham for the team project, Paul Swisher would also be helping with 
## Team Roster

You may edit this Markdown file directly and use the next available Team number when you are ready, typically in Weeks 3 or 4 after you've had a chance to pair program with 7 or 8 of your classmates. Students continuing from DSA in fall quarter: you may wish to consider new students as additions to your existing team, or to form an entirely new team and project.

You will be asked to choose a team as the quarter progresses and as you are randomly assigned to pair programming partners in each class. You may change teams one or two times as you get to know your classmates and yourself as a programmer and as you pick up skills through the weekly assignments, code interviews, and co-creation. Towards the middle and end of the quarter, you will combine all of these to focus on your final team project, which you will demo to the wider computer science community at Evergreen two times:
* the middle of the quarter, the Thursday of Week 5
* the end of the quarter, the Thursday of Week 10.

The TAs will schedule teams for the demo days.
