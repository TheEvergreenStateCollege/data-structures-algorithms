# Software Setup

We will be following curricula from the Front End Masters website,
focusing on Typescript, React, NextJS
with some later topics on 3D programming.

We will continue to use the same GitPod workspace that you've 
become familiar with in the previous quarter.

## Enable and Register Accounts

### GitHub Student Developer Pack
You will have 6 months free access to Front End Masters as part of
the GitHub Student Developer Pack. If you haven't already enabled 
your benefits to your GitHub account (created in Autumn '23 quarter)

https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student 

It may take a few days for GitHub to approve your Student Developer 
Pack benefits. Until they're enabled, you won't be able to access 
the Front End Masters website. Don't worry, the first week of
Engineering for the Web will include self-contained exercises that
you can do while waiting.

### Front End Masters

Once you're GitHub student benefits are enabled (you'll receive
a notification in your email), you can create a Front End Masters
account using those benefits here:
